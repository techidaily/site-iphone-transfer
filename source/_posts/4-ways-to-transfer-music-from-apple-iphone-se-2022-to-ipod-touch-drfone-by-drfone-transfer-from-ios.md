## Part 3: How to transfer everything from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 8/11/11 Pro with iCloud?

iCloud is another great way to transfer Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 8/11/11 Pro in hassle free manner. Since it is a cloud service by Apple, it stores all our data and allows us to restore it on any and every iOS device with the same Apple ID and password.

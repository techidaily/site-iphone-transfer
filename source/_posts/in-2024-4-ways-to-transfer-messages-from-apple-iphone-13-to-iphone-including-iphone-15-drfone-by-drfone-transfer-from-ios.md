## How to Transfer Data from iOS Devices to Motorola Phones

**Issues about transferring data from Apple iPhone 13 to Motorola G5/G5Plus**

There are several items like contacts and calendar that you could transfer from Apple iPhone 13 to Motorola phone. Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.

For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

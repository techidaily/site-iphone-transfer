## Part 3. Sync contacts from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone Including iPhone 15 by iCloud syncing

You can easily learn how to transfer contacts from one iPhone to another (like iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro) using iCloud syncing. It takes very little time, and all it needs is one apple account signed in to both your source and target iPhones at a time. Just follow these steps properly-

**Merge Contacts**

You need to go to the “Settings” option of your source iPhone and tap on your name at the top of the settings screen. Check the “Contacts” option is toggled on or not from the “iCloud” option. After that, hit merge to upload your contacts on iCloud.

You need to use the Apple ID and password on your target phone and do the same thing to toggle on the “Contacts” option from “iCloud” and wait until your iPhone asks you to merge contacts.

**Refresh Contacts**

After choosing the “Merge” option, you will see that existing contacts and previous contacts from the source iPhone will merge on your target iPhone. Now you need to refresh the contact list, which will allow you to find all the old contacts to your target iPhone.

**Install iTunes and connect source iPhone**

Download the latest version of iTunes on your PC, install it properly, and launch the software. Connect your source iPhone to your PC, and iTunes will automatically detect it.

**Backup Contacts**

Now click on the “Device” option and then select iPhone. Then you need to select the “Summary” option and then choose “This Computer” and “Back Up Now” to back up all your data and contacts on your PC.

In the end, you need to connect your target iPhone to your PC and choose the “Summary” option in the iTunes software. You need to choose the “Restore Backup” option and then browse and select the latest backup folder.

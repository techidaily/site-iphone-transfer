## Part 3: Export iPhone contacts to CSV using iCloud

If you don’t want to take the assistance of any third-party app to export iPhone contacts to Excel free, then you can also use iCloud. The process of exporting iPhone contacts to Excel using iCloud is a little tedious compared to other methods. Though, these steps will help you meet your requirements.

1\. Before you proceed, make sure that you have already synced your iPhone contacts with iCloud by visiting its Settings on your device.

2\. Afterward, go to the official website of iCloud and log in with your credentials. From its welcome page, select the Contacts option.

3\. Click on the gear icon (Settings) on the bottom left corner. From here, you can select all contacts in one go. Though, if you wish, you can manually select the contacts you wish to export as well.

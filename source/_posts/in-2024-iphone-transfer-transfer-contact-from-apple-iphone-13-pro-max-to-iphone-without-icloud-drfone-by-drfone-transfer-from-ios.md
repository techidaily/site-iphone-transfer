## 4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud

We will start by exploring the 4 basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud. Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:

### Method 1. AirDrop

AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:

- **Step 1:** Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the "Wireless" box, and long press the "AirDrop." Now, set its visibility to "Contacts Only" or "Everyone for 10 Minutes." Then, move your iPhone's Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.

![share contact using airdrop feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg)

### Method 2. NameDrop

NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:

- **Step 1:** To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.

![enable the namedrop feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

- **Step 2:** If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either "Share" or "Receive Only." If you wish to exchange contact information, select "Share." The recipient can opt for "Receive Only" to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device's data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

- **Step 2:** Move to the "Backups" section on iTunes/Finder and click "Back Up Now." Before this, confirm the selection of "This Computer" in iTunes and for Finder" or "Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac."

![back up latest data on computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary/General” tab and click "Restore Backup." Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.

### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Tap "Send" to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won't be added directly. To save the contact, tap "Create New Contact," write any contact details, and select "Done" to finish saving the contact.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

## FAQS

1. **How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Samsung?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated "WhatsApp Transfer" feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the "WhatsApp Transfer" option, and initiate the transfer. Dr.Fone efficiently moves WhatsApp chats, messages, and media from your iPhone to the Samsung device, ensuring a seamless transition of your conversations without compromising data integrity.

2. **Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?**

Before transitioning from an iPhone to a non-Apple device, such as a Samsung phone, it is recommended to disable iMessage. This step is crucial as it prevents text messages intended for your phone number from being directed solely through iMessage. By deactivating iMessage, you facilitate the reception of SMS messages on your new Samsung device without any interference.

3. **What if I face issues during the transfer process?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

- Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.
- Verify for any pending software updates on both devices and proceed with their installation if available.
- Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.
- For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.

4. **Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?**

Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.

Learning about the iPhone to Samsung transfer is easy when you have a clear and precise guideline. With the help of this article, you will not only be able to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Samsung but also completely switch your device in a very short time.

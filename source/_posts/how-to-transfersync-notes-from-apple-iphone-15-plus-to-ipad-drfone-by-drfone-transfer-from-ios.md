Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple's official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.

Ensure the used Apple iPhone 15 Plus you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.

Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 15 Plus comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.

Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you're getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.

Don’t worry – you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.

Select your iPhone and go to its “Info” tab. From here, you can sync its contacts with iTunes. This will keep your contacts safe and allow you to sync them with another iOS device.

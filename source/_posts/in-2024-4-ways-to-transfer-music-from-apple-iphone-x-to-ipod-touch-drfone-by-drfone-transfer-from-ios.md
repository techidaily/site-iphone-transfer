## How to Transfer Data from iOS Devices to Motorola Phones

**Issues about transferring data from Apple iPhone X to Motorola G5/G5Plus**

There are several items like contacts and calendar that you could transfer from Apple iPhone X to Motorola phone. Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.

One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.

For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.

## Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android with iCloud

Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

**1.** Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are **synced with iCloud**. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.

**2.** Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and **log in** with your Apple ID.

**3.** After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the "Contacts" option from the home screen.

**4.** This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.

**5.** Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose "**Export vCard**." This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.

**6.** Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.

**7.** From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.

**8.** Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.

## Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android using iTunes

If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account.

Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android using iTunes.

**1.** Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.

**2.** Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the "**Sync Contacts**" option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.

Often, users don't wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup.

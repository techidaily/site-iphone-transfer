These attributes must be fulfilled before switching to ensure a smooth transition. That's why we want you to look at these prerequisites and fulfill them before moving to your new device. Here's a checklist of these pre-requirements before **transferring the iPhone to Samsung**.

1. **Backup Your iPhone:** First of all, you have to ensure you have backed up your iPhone before proceeding with data transfer. This step will secure your data from losing or deleting it. Moreover, you can access it from any device whenever you need to. You can perform the backup by turning on the iCloud backup option from the iPhone.
2. **Battery Percentage:** Another critical aspect is to charge both your iPhone and Samsung device to an adequate battery level. This will prevent any interruption due to low battery during the transfer process. Also, the performance of the Apple iPhone 7 devices will be optimum at the ideal battery percentage.
3. **Update Software:** Furthermore, you should confirm that both your iPhone and Samsung devices are running the latest operating system software. You must update your iPhone to the latest iOS version and your Samsung device to the latest Android version.
4. **Secure Your Data:** When you are done with the transferring process, it is necessary to clear your data from the old phone. Although the iPhone is one of the most secure devices, you should reset it before leaving. This will ensure that no one can access your files after you have wiped off all your data.

## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

## Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android with iCloud

Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

**1.** Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are **synced with iCloud**. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.

**2.** Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and **log in** with your Apple ID.

**3.** After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the "Contacts" option from the home screen.

## Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android using iTunes

If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android using iTunes.

**1.** Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.

**2.** Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the "**Sync Contacts**" option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.

**3.** Ensure that you choose to sync "All Contacts" before clicking on the "**Apply" button**.

**4.** Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone XS Max device. Go to your Account > Contacts and click on the "Export" button on the toolbar.

**5.** Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.

**6.** In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone XS Max or import it to your Google Contacts as well.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus or tablet.

When switching from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts.

That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

- _Software crashed and we lost years of family photos, including photos of our kids with nanna who passed away recently. The scam part is this, if you go to the website you will notice they do data recovery, you can also download for free but to actually recover 'photos' etc, you have to pay $50.00 USD and there is the scam. They create the issue with the free software and then they sting you to give you back your photos. Warn everybody you know. BEWARE._

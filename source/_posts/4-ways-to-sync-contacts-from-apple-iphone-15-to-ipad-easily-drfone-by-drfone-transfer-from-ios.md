Don't have a computer at hand? Just try the [Android app of Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.mobiletrans&hl=en), which allows you to directly **transfer data from Apple iPhone 15 to Android**, and bring iCloud data to Android without any hassle.



## Method 2. Transfer Data One by One from Apple iPhone 15 to Android for Free

Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone 15 to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 15 to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it's impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 15 or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 15 to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 15 or tablet.

### Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android via iCloud

When switching from Apple iPhone 15 to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

Don't worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it's easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.

Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to _Settings_ and select _iCloud_.

Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on _Contacts_ to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.

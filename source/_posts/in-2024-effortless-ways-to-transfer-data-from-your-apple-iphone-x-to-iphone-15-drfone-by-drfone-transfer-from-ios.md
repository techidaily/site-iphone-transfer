While you can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to SIM directly, you can always move your contacts from one phone to another. We have listed some easy solutions to help you resolve your query on how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone with some alternative methods.

### Save your contacts to iCloud

By default, every user gets a free space of 5 GB on iCloud (which can later be expanded). Therefore, you can easily take a backup of your contacts and other important files on iCloud. Just go to your device’s Settings > iCloud and turn the backup option on. Make sure that the backup for Contacts is turned on as well. This will sync your contacts to iCloud, letting you access them on the go. In this way, you don’t have to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to SIM.

## Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone X Data Directly to iPhone 15?

While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone X  to the new one.

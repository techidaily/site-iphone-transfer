### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices.

### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.

Have you pay-front apps on your iDevice that you paid for?

The App Store and Google Play Store are entirely different entities and the housed apps are designed for different platforms. Some apps you had on your iDevice may not even be accessible for your Google Pixel device and vice-versa. However, if you’ve subscribed to a service such as Spotify, you just have to get the app and sign in to your new Android device and that’s it.

## Part 3: How to Transfer Everything from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 with iCloud

iCould is another software which also enables the transfer of data from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11. In order to transfer data Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 using iCloud, you can consider the following steps to make the process easy.

1. Just like iTunes, with iCloud too you need to back up your data to iCloud so that it can be restored to your new iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11. In order to back up, first you need to connect the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device to the Wi-Fi network. Then go to the setting, click on iCloud button and then click on to iCloud backup. You need to check whether the iCloud backup is turned on or not. Make sure it is turned on. Click on "**back up now**". Keep your phone connected to Wi-Fi until the process is completed.

1. Connect your iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 to the computer when "Hello" screen appears.

1. The application will ask for the backup. Once you've checked that the backup is correct you can click on it.
2. Make sure your device is connected to it until the process is completed.

iTunes, iCloud and Dr.Fone are few of the methods which tend to enable the **transfer data from old iPhone to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11**. However, considering the complexity of the iTunes and iCloud, we'd urge the readers if they can try the Dr.Fone at least once. It is not only easy but also less time consuming. It prevents the additional steps such as backup and restore settings. Rather, the entire process is done with just one click. Dr.Fone is highly user friendly and a bit different from traditional ways of transfer data Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11.

We know the emotions and sentiments attached with one’s personal information and thus we have tried to give users a platform, where they can make the transition from one phone to another extremely simple. Simply download and have a try.

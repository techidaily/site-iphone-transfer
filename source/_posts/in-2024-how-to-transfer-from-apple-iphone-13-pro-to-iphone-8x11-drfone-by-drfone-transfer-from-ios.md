Given below are the 4 official methods to transfer your data to the new iPhone 15:

### Method 1: Using iCloud Backup

iCloud Backup emerges as a powerful solution when it comes to transferring your data to the iPhone 15. Apple's cloud-based ecosystem enables you to migrate your essential information seamlessly. It ensures that your new device is an extension of your digital world. Follow these steps to use iCloud Backup for a smooth transition:

- **Step 1:** First, we begin with creating a backup of your old iPhone. To do that, you need to navigate to Settings and tap Apple ID. Here choose “iCloud” and follow it by tapping "iCloud Backup." Ensure it is toggled on, and use “Back Up Now” to create an iCloud backup.

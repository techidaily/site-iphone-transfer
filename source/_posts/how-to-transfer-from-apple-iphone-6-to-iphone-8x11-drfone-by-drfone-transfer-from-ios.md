Transitioning to the new iPhone 15 is an exciting experience. It means you need to ensure that your data seamlessly makes the journey to the new iPhone 15. Apple provides a convenient way to transfer your data in the form of iCloud. You can create an iCloud backup of your old device and restore it to the new one. Use the following guide to **transfer to iPhone 15** with iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 6 , navigate to "Settings," tap on your Apple ID, select "iCloud," and then "iCloud Backup." Here tap "Back Up Now" to create an iCloud back of your iPhone data.

- **Step 2:** Power on your iPhone 15 and follow the setup prompts until you reach the "Apps & Data" screen. Then, proceed with the "Restore from iCloud Backup" feature and sign in using your Apple ID credentials.
- **Step 3:** A list of available iCloud backups will appear on the screen. Here you need to select the most recent backup from your Apple iPhone 6 . Keep in mind that a reliable Wi-Fi connection is essential for a smooth and speedy transfer.

## Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone 6 Data Directly to iPhone 15?

While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone 6  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the "Quick Start" method, and you can use it by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone 6  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone 6  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.
- **Step 2:** A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone 6 , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping "Continue." Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.

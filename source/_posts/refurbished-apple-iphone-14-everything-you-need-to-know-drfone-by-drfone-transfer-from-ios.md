## **Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?**

Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.

On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 14 from a private seller, make sure that it's not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.

It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.

## **Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.**

Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 14 device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:

1. **Seller Reputation**

Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple's official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.

**Compatibility**

Ensure the used Apple iPhone 14 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.

**Storage**

Choose the Apple iPhone 14 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.

**Warranty Coverage**

Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty's duration and what it covers.

**Condition and History**

Ask questions about the phone's condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.

**Return Policy**

Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.

**Original Accessories**

Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 14 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.

**Price Comparison**

Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you're getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.

By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.

- Switch to your Apple iPhone 14, open Google Play Store, and search for ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.

- On your Apple iPhone 14, enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-enrer the code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-9.jpg)

Before the transfer starts, you will be asked a number of questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only want videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll’

On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder.

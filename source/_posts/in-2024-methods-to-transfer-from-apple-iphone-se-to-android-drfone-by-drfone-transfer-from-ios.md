Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone SE to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone SE to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files.

However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone SE or tablet.

### Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone SE to Android via iCloud

When switching from Apple iPhone SE to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on _Contacts_ to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.

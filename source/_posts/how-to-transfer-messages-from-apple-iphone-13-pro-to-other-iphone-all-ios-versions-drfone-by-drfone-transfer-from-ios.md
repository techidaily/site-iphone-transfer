The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### 5\. Compatibility Issues

Older iPhone models might not support the latest iOS versions or certain features. It leads to compatibility issues when transferring data between devices. This is a prominent issue when dealing with different iOS versions.

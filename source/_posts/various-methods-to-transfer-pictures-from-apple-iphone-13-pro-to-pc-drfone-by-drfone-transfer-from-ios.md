## Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android with iCloud

Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

## Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?

A lot of users take the assistance of SIM card to save their contacts. If you are also doing the same, then you can easily learn how to import SIM contacts to iPhone. Simply go to your device’s Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar and tap on “Import SIM Contacts”.

![import sim contacts to iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151409125783.jpg)

Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn’t provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.

Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can’t export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly. This is because Apple assumes the transfer of contacts via SIM card is an obsolete method. Don’t worry – you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.

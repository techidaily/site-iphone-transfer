iTunes match is another way to process of transfer music purchased or unpurchased from iTunes from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPod. In fact, iTunes match determines the song, which is present in the iCloud and since there are over 43 million songs, iTunes match matches these unpurchased songs with the database and allows playing these music from the iCloud store. Now, you just need to tap the iCloud download button to download music from an artist, album or playlist. Thus, a person has immediate access to a huge music library without having to worry about the storage space on your device.

How to **transfer iPhone photos to a computer** using iCloud:

**Step 1:** Make sure you have synced iCloud photos on your iPhone.

On your iPhone Settings, go to your profile and tap iCloud. Then, select Photos and turn on the switch next to “Sync this \[device\].” Otherwise, go to iCloud settings > iCloud Drive, and switch on “Sync this iPhone.”

Open Google Drive on your iPhone. Once opened, tap the multicolored + symbol and select "Upload" > "Photos and Videos." If prompted, grant access to all photos by tapping "Allow Access to All Photos."

## **Part 3: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with iTunes**

You can also make the most of iTunes to secure your iPhone with backups, keep it up-to-date, or synchronize content between your iOS device and your computer in both directions. Even if you're a Windows PC user, there's no need to fret. Although iTunes is an Apple product, it’s also available for Windows use.

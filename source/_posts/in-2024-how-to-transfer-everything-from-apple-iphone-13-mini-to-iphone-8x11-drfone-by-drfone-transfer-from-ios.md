## Part 2: Transfer old iPhone data to iPhone 12

We know that the excitement of buying a new iPhone is real. However, it's important to do one thing before jumping into the camera quality. And that's data transfer. You do not want your old phone data to be gone with the old device, do you? We hope not. Here are some of the tactics by which you can transfer the old iPhone data to the new iPhone 12

### 2.1 Through iCloud

![transfer data through icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/mobiletrans/iPhone-12-3.jpg)

Before transferring, make sure your data is backed up. For that, connect the old iPhone with the WiFi and then go to "Settings." Next, tap your name and then on "iCloud." Next, select the "Backup Now" option and wait for the process to get completed. After completing the backup, follow the steps given below.

**Step 1:** First, turn on the new device to see the "Hello" screen. Now, follow the instructions appearing on the screen. Once you notice the WiFi screen, tap a WiFi network to join. Keep following the steps till the "Apps & Data" screen shows up. Tap on "Restore from iCloud."

**Step 2:** Sign in to your iCloud with relevant credentials like Apple ID and password. Choose a backup but make sure to check the date and size.

If you have bought iTunes or App store content with multiple IDs, sign in with those accounts too.

**Step 3:** The restore process will be initiated. Make sure to be connected and wait till the process gets completed successfully. Once done, continue with the other steps to complete the setup process successfully.

### 2.2 Through iTunes or Finder

Start with the backup process by opening iTunes. Now, connect your iPhone with the PC. After it gets connected, choose your iPhone on the top toolbar. To transfer the data related to Health and Activity/saved passwords, choose the "Encrypt backup" option. Next, input a password and click "Back Up Now."

To transfer the data through iTunes or Finder, launch your new device. Once the "Hello" screen appears, follow the instructions appearing on the screen. As soon as you note the "Apps & Data Screen," tap on "Restore from Mac or PC." Connect the new device to PC/Mac and open the iTunes/Finder window. Once your device name is visible on the screen, tap it.

Select "Restore Backup" to choose a "Backup." Ensure that the size and data are accurate. To restore from an encrypted backup, input the password. The restoration process will start. Now, wait for the entire process to get completed and then move on to the remaining setup steps.

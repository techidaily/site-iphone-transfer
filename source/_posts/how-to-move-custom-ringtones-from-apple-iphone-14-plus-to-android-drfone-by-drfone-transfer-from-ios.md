## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

- **Step 2. Pick Source and Destination Positions**

Your old iPhone from which you are transferring data will be the "Source" device. Similarly, your new iPhone to which you want to move data will be in the "Destination" position. In case positions are wrong, use the "Flip" button to interchange the positions.

- **Step 3. Start and Complete the Data Transfer Process**

The last part includes selecting the data you want to transfer. You can select the data within the transfer screen and, upon making your choices, proceed by clicking "Start Transfer." It's important to note that during this process, you'll need to deactivate the "Find My" feature on iOS devices. When done, the data process will commence automatically.

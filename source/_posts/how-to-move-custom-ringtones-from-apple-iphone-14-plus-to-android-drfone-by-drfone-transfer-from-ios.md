## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### 5\. Compatibility Issues

Older iPhone models might not support the latest iOS versions or certain features. It leads to compatibility issues when transferring data between devices. This is a prominent issue when dealing with different iOS versions.

## Part 2: Transfer photos from Android to iPhone including iPhone 15/15 Pro(Max) using Move to iOS App?

Now, to answer how to transfer photos from Android to iPhone, there is another simple solution that you can make use of. It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.

Note: This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App.

Now to proceed, first of all, you need to do some settings on your iPhone device as follows:

On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps & Data’ > choose ‘Move Data from Android’ option.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
The next step is to take your Apple iPhone 6s to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- Switch to your Apple iPhone 6s, open Google Play Store, and search for ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
- At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- On your Apple iPhone 6s, enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Before the transfer starts, you will be asked a number of questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only want videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll’

The above process to transfer pictures from Android to iPhone is good for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.

## Part 3: How to transfer photos from Android to iPhone using Google Drive?

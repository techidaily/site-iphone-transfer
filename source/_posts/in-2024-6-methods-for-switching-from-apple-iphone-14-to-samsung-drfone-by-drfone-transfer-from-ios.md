## Part 2: How To Transfer Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Backup to iPhone 15?

Transitioning to the new iPhone 15 is an exciting experience. It means you need to ensure that your data seamlessly makes the journey to the new iPhone 15. Apple provides a convenient way to transfer your data in the form of iCloud. You can create an iCloud backup of your old device and restore it to the new one. Use the following guide to **transfer to iPhone 15** with iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 14 , navigate to "Settings," tap on your Apple ID, select "iCloud," and then "iCloud Backup." Here tap "Back Up Now" to create an iCloud back of your iPhone data.

- **Step 2:** Power on your iPhone 15 and follow the setup prompts until you reach the "Apps & Data" screen. Then, proceed with the "Restore from iCloud Backup" feature and sign in using your Apple ID credentials.
- **Step 3:** A list of available iCloud backups will appear on the screen. Here you need to select the most recent backup from your Apple iPhone 14 . Keep in mind that a reliable Wi-Fi connection is essential for a smooth and speedy transfer.

## Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone 14 Data Directly to iPhone 15?

While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone 14  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the "Quick Start" method, and you can use it by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone 14  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone 14  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.
- **Step 2:** A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone 14 , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping "Continue." Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.

![press the continue button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** This animation contains security information and establishes a connection between devices. On the new iPhone, you will be required to provide the old phone passcode. Enter the passcode and log in using your Apple ID. Subsequently, select "Transfer from iPhone" and patiently await the process to finish.

Looking for a more hands-on approach to data transfer? Using iTunes/Finder can be an effective way in this scenario. It is a recommended way if you have larger backups stored on your computer. To migrate your data from an old iPhone to the new iPhone 15 with iTunes/Finder, you can use the following steps:

- **Step 1:** Make sure you have the latest version of iTunes/Finder installed on your computer. First, connect your Apple iPhone 14  to the computer and create a backup through the "Summary/General" tab. After the backup has finished, proceed to disconnect the old iPhone.

## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 6s Plus Stuck on Data Transfer

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

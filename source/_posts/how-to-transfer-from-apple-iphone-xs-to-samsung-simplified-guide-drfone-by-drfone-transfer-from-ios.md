Samsung Smart Switch is an efficient and convenient software for **transferring an iPhone to Samsung**. However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:

1. **App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.

## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

## Conclusion

In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to **transfer from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung.** However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users. We have provided you with a more effective and powerful solution: Wondershare Dr.Fone. This tool will assist you in **transferring your iPhone to Samsung** with just one click.

## Part 3: Other solutions to transfer iPhone contacts

While you can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM directly, you can always move your contacts from one phone to another. We have listed some easy solutions to help you resolve your query on how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone with some alternative methods.

### Save your contacts to iCloud

By default, every user gets a free space of 5 GB on iCloud (which can later be expanded). Therefore, you can easily take a backup of your contacts and other important files on iCloud. Just go to your device’s Settings > iCloud and turn the backup option on. Make sure that the backup for Contacts is turned on as well. This will sync your contacts to iCloud, letting you access them on the go. In this way, you don’t have to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM.

### Export iPhone contacts Via iTunes

Another alternative to learning how to export contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Simply connect your Apple iPhone XS to the system and launch iTunes. Select your iPhone and go to its “Info” tab. From here, you can sync its contacts with iTunes. This will keep your contacts safe and allow you to sync them with another iOS device.

## Part 5: How to transfer from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung using email?

When manually migrating data from an iPhone to a Samsung device, email can be a viable option. This method is best suited for smaller quantities of data due to email attachment limitations. It's effective for transferring photos, documents, contacts, or smaller files. Here's a step-by-step guide to help with this method:

**Step 1.** On your iPhone, navigate to the data you want to transfer and long-press to select it. Then, tap the “Share” icon in the drop-down list and choose to send via “Email.” Open your email app on your iPhone and create a new email. Following this, type your email address in the "To" field to proceed further.

**Step 2.** Attach the selected files to the email. Once all the files are attached, send the email to yourself. Open the "Gmail" app on your Samsung device and access the email you sent yourself from the iPhone. Next, open the email and download the attached files to your Samsung device. You can download them by tapping the “Download” icon.

## FAQS

1. **How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated "WhatsApp Transfer" feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the "WhatsApp Transfer" option, and initiate the transfer. Dr.Fone efficiently moves WhatsApp chats, messages, and media from your iPhone to the Samsung device, ensuring a seamless transition of your conversations without compromising data integrity.

2. **Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?**

Before transitioning from an iPhone to a non-Apple device, such as a Samsung phone, it is recommended to disable iMessage. This step is crucial as it prevents text messages intended for your phone number from being directed solely through iMessage. By deactivating iMessage, you facilitate the reception of SMS messages on your new Samsung device without any interference.

3. **What if I face issues during the transfer process?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

- Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.
- Verify for any pending software updates on both devices and proceed with their installation if available.
- Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.
- For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.

4. **Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?**

Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.

Learning about the iPhone to Samsung transfer is easy when you have a clear and precise guideline. With the help of this article, you will not only be able to transfer data from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung but also completely switch your device in a very short time.

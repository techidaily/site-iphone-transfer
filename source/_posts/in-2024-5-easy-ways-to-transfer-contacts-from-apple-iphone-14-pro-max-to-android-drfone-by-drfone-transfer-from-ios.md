Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

Here are answers to some of the FAQs available on the internet regarding how to change a SIM card on an iPhone.

1. **Can I use the same eSIM card to switch between different Apple iPhone XS and other iPhones?**

Yes, you can use the same eSIM card to switch between different Apple iPhone XS and other iPhones, provided that the specific carrier supports eSIM technology and allows the transfer of the eSIM between devices.

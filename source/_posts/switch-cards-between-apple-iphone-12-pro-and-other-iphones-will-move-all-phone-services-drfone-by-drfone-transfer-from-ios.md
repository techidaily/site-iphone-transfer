You can easily learn how to transfer contacts from one iPhone to another (like iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro) using iCloud syncing. It takes very little time, and all it needs is one apple account signed in to both your source and target iPhones at a time. Just follow these steps properly-

**Merge Contacts**

You need to go to the “Settings” option of your source iPhone and tap on your name at the top of the settings screen. Check the “Contacts” option is toggled on or not from the “iCloud” option. After that, hit merge to upload your contacts on iCloud.

You need to use the Apple ID and password on your target phone and do the same thing to toggle on the “Contacts” option from “iCloud” and wait until your iPhone asks you to merge contacts.

**Refresh Contacts**

After choosing the “Merge” option, you will see that existing contacts and previous contacts from the source iPhone will merge on your target iPhone. Now you need to refresh the contact list, which will allow you to find all the old contacts to your target iPhone.

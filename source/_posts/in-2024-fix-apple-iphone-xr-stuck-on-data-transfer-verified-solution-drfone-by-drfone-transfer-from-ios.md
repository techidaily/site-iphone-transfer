If you are among these iPhone lovers, we congratulate you in advance for buying the latest iPhone device out there. However, we also want to warn you about some problems while you try to transfer the data from your old iPhone or Android device.

As the full-fledged sale of the Apple iPhone XR began, many people faced the **Apple iPhone XR stuck transferring data** issues. If you are one of those people, this article will help you identify the problem and provide the best solution to tackle this issue.

![iphone 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/09/fix-iphone-15-data-transfer-issue-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone XR Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone XR to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone XR to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone XR using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

### **4\. Problem in the iOS Version**

When performing iPhone-to-iPhone data transfer, ensure that both iPhones are free from any iOS bugs. For this purpose, update your older iPhone to the latest iOS version to avoid bugs and glitches. If you are using the iOS 17 Beta version on your old iPhone, it can also cause this issue.

### 3\. Syncios

Syncios also works as a decent iTunes alternative to transfer data between iOS devices and PC. The app allows users to transfer videos, photos, ringtones. TV shows, playlist, notes and all other data between iPhone/iPad/iPod and PC easily and quickly.

Pros

- Comes with easy setup wizard
- Excellent using experience when transfer files

Cons

- Free software does not comes with selected options to choose from
- Some users complain about the software collapse.

User Reviews

- _Software crashed and we lost years of family photos, including photos of our kids with nanna who passed away recently. The scam part is this, if you go to the website you will notice they do data recovery, you can also download for free but to actually recover 'photos' etc, you have to pay $50.00 USD and there is the scam. They create the issue with the free software and then they sting you to give you back your photos. Warn everybody you know. BEWARE._
- _Since I go through lots of music, videos, photos, I had to be able to backup the iPhones and this is where iTunes got kinda complicated for me. SyncIOS make the use of my Apple device much more user-friendly and comfortable._

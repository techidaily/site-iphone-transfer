<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

## Part 1: Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone Including iPhone 12/ 12 Pro (Max)/ 12 Mini with iTunes

To start with, let’s learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone using iTunes. If you have an updated version of iTunes, you can transfer and sync your data between various devices. Ideally, you can either sync your contacts or backup and restore them. We have discussed both of these techniques to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone with iTunes.

### Method 1: Backup and Restore iPhone contacts with iTunes

This is the easiest approach to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone with iTunes. In this, we will first take a backup of our old phone (including contacts) and later restore the backup to a new device. Needless to say, all the existing data on the target device would be erased, and with your contacts, the entire backup will be restored.

- **1.** Firstly, connect your existing iPhone to your system and launch iTunes.
- **2.** Select your device and visit its Summary section.
- **3.** Under the Backups section, choose to take a backup on the local computer.
- **4.** In the end, click on the “Backup Now” button and wait for iTunes to backup your device entirely.

- **5.** Once you have taken a backup locally, you can connect the target device and go to its Summary.
- **6.** From here, click on the “Restore Backup” and select the target backup and device.

### Method 2: Sync Contacts with iTunes

If you only wish to transfer your contacts, then it can be achieved by syncing your device. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone using iTunes, follow these steps:

- **1.** Firstly, connect your existing iPhone to your system and launch an updated version of iTunes.

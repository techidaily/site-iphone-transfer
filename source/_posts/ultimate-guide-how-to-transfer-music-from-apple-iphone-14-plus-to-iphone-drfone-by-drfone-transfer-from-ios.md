### Method 2. NameDrop

NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone.

![freceive or share contacts via namedrop](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg)

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice.

Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of.

The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

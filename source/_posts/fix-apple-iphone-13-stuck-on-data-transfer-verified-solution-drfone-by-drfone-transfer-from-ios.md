### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 13 to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone 13 to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone 13 using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

When performing iPhone-to-iPhone data transfer, ensure that both iPhones are free from any iOS bugs. For this purpose, update your older iPhone to the latest iOS version to avoid bugs and glitches. If you are using the iOS 17 Beta version on your old iPhone, it can also cause this issue.

## Part 3: Other solutions to transfer iPhone contacts

While you can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to SIM directly, you can always move your contacts from one phone to another. We have listed some easy solutions to help you resolve your query on how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone with some alternative methods.

### Save your contacts to iCloud

By default, every user gets a free space of 5 GB on iCloud (which can later be expanded). Therefore, you can easily take a backup of your contacts and other important files on iCloud. Just go to your device’s Settings > iCloud and turn the backup option on. Make sure that the backup for Contacts is turned on as well. This will sync your contacts to iCloud, letting you access them on the go. In this way, you don’t have to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to SIM.

### Export iPhone contacts Via iTunes

Another alternative to learning how to export contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to SIM is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Simply connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the system and launch iTunes. Select your iPhone and go to its “Info” tab. From here, you can sync its contacts with iTunes. This will keep your contacts safe and allow you to sync them with another iOS device.

### Copy iPhone Contacts Using Gmail

Just like iCloud, you can also sync your contacts with Gmail. If you don’t use Gmail, then go to your iPhone’s Accounts Settings and set up your Gmail account. Later, you can go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Gmail and toggle on the syncing option for Contacts.

## Part 2: Transfer photos from Android to iPhone including iPhone 15/15 Pro(Max) using Move to iOS App?

Now, to answer how to transfer photos from Android to iPhone, there is another simple solution that you can make use of. It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.

Note: This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App.

Now to proceed, first of all, you need to do some settings on your iPhone device as follows:

On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps & Data’ > choose ‘Move Data from Android’ option.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

The next step is to take your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- Switch to your Apple iPhone SE (2020), open Google Play Store, and search for ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
- At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android device.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move from android to ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-8.jpg)

- On your Apple iPhone SE (2020), enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Before the transfer starts, you will be asked a number of questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only want videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll’

The above process to transfer pictures from Android to iPhone is good for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.

**Step 1.** On your iPhone, navigate to the data you want to transfer and long-press to select it.

## FAQS

1. **How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to Samsung?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated "WhatsApp Transfer" feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the "WhatsApp Transfer" option, and initiate the transfer. Dr.Fone efficiently moves WhatsApp chats, messages, and media from your iPhone to the Samsung device, ensuring a seamless transition of your conversations without compromising data integrity.

2. **Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?**

Before transitioning from an iPhone to a non-Apple device, such as a Samsung phone, it is recommended to disable iMessage. This step is crucial as it prevents text messages intended for your phone number from being directed solely through iMessage. By deactivating iMessage, you facilitate the reception of SMS messages on your new Samsung device without any interference.

3. **What if I face issues during the transfer process?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

- Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.
- Verify for any pending software updates on both devices and proceed with their installation if available.
- Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.
- For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.

4. **Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?**

Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.

Learning about the iPhone to Samsung transfer is easy when you have a clear and precise guideline. With the help of this article, you will not only be able to transfer data from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to Samsung but also completely switch your device in a very short time.

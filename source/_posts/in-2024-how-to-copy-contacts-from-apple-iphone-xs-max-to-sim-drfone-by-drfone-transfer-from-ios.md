![download the desired photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-8.jpg)

#### Con

- The provided 5GB of free cloud storage falls significantly short of meeting the requirements for adequate data backup.

### Method 2: Google Drive

This enables easy photo transfer between various platforms. You get 15GB of free storage with Google Drive to store and transfer your data.

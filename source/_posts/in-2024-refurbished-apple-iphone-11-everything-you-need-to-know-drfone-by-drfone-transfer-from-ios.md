## Refurbished Apple iPhone 11: Everything You Need to Know

Are you planning to buy a new Apple iPhone 11 but feeling a pinch in your wallet? Have you ever wondered if there is a more affordable way to own the latest iPhone? If yes, then you are at the right place.

You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?

![A picture of a second-hand iPhone.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png)

In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones. What are they, and how they can be a budget-friendly alternative? We will answer everything you need to know.

But before starting, let’s shed some light on what refurbished iPhones actually are because some people aren’t aware of this term.

## **Part 1. What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone 11 mean?**

Before going further, let's clarify what exactly a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 is. In simple words, you can say that it is a device that has gone through a series of checks and repairs. So that it can work the same way as a brand-new Apple iPhone 11 does. If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.

When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 11 device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn't go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 11 device's functions to stop. Moreover, it's also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.

Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.

## **Part 2. What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?**

No doubt, refurbished iPhones are the same as the new ones. So, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the brand-new Apple iPhone 11 at a lower price. If you are fine with a few scratches, refurbished iPhones have a lot more to offer you. The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone 11 are as follows:

- **Cost Savings**

One of the major benefits of purchasing a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 is the cost savings. These devices are more affordable than brand-new ones. You can enjoy the latest features without breaking the bank.

![An illustration of saving cost.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-2.png)

- **Quality Assurance**

Refurbished iPhones are carefully inspected and tested to ensure that they meet Apple's high standards. They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 will look and perform like a new iPhone.

- **Environmental Friendly**

When you get a refurbished item, you're giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that's awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.

![An illustration of eco-friendly technology.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png)

- **Warranty and Support**

If you get a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 from Apple, you get a one-year warranty. You also get 90 days of free technical support. So, this warranty provides you peace of mind, just like you get when you buy a new iPhone.

- **Miscellaneous Benefits**

Refurbished iPhones are usually available in a variety of models. They also come with the latest software updates so that you can enjoy the newest features. These phones are reliable; you can trust that they will perform well.

Well, we have explored the benefits, but is it safe to buy a refurbished iPhone? Let's find out!

## **Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?**

Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.

On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 from a private seller, make sure that it's not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.

It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.

## **Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.**

Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 11 device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:

1. **Seller Reputation**

Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple's official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.

**Compatibility**

Ensure the used Apple iPhone 11 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.

**Storage**

Choose the Apple iPhone 11 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.

**Warranty Coverage**

Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty's duration and what it covers.

**Condition and History**

Ask questions about the phone's condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.

**Return Policy**

Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.

**Original Accessories**

Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 11 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.

**Price Comparison**

Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you're getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.

By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 11 to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device's data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

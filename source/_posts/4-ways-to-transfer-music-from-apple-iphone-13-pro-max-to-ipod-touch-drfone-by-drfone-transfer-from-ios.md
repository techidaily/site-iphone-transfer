**Note:** _When you have no computer at hand, you can just get the [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer (mobile version)](http://cms40.wondershare.cn/) from Google Play. After installing this Android app, you can download iCloud data to your ZTE directly, or connect iPhone to ZTE for data transfer using an iPhone-to-Android adapter._

It can be very easy to sync contacts to a new phone especially if you are using a service like Google, but it is all the other stuff such as pictures, videos, text messages and your calendar that can be hard to move unless you are tech savvy. Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer makes it so easy, all you need is to simply install this software utility and then connect both phones to a PC. Both phones must however be connected at the same time in order for this service to work. This means that you cannot back up contents from your iOS device to transfer at a later time. This problem is however negated by the fact that it will take a very short time to transfer everything, so there is no need to back-up anything.

We will start by exploring the 4 basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud. Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:

Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:

![share contact using airdrop feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg)

### Method 2. NameDrop

NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:

- **Step 1:** To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.

![enable the namedrop feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg)

- **Step 2:** If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either "Share" or "Receive Only." If you wish to exchange contact information, select "Share." The recipient can opt for "Receive Only" to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.

![freceive or share contacts via namedrop](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg)

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device's data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Move to the "Backups" section on iTunes/Finder and click "Back Up Now." Before this, confirm the selection of "This Computer" in iTunes and for Finder" or "Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac."

![back up latest data on computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary/General” tab and click "Restore Backup." Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.

![Image alt: restore most recent backup](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg)

### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg)

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

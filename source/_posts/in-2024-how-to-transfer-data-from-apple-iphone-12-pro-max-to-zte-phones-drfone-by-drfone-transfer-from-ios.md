When switching from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts.

That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

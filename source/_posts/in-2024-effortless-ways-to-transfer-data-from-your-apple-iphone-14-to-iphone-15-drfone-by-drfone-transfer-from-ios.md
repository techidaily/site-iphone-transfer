## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 15 Plus Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone 15 Plus to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

## Everything You Need to Know About Shared Album

The Photos mobile application on iOS devices is a very powerful gallery software. It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone.”

It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.

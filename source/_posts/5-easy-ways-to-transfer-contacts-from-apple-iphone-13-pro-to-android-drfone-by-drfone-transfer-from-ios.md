## Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android with Google Account

Another fast and hassle-free way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android is by using your Google Account. Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account.

To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

**1.** Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are **synced with iCloud**. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.

Often, users don't wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

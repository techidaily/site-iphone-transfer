As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it's impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone XS Max or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone XS Max or tablet.

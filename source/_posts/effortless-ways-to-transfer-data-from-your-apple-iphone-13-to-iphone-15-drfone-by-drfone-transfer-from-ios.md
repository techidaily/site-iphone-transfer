**6.** In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 13 or import it to your Google Contacts as well.

## Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android without a computer

Often, users don't wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN). To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android, follow these steps.

**1.** Firstly, download the **My Contacts app** on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.

**2.** The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.

**3.** You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.

**4.** Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.

**5.** Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 13 and Google Play Store.

**6.** Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard. In this way, all the saved contacts will be exported to your Apple iPhone 13.

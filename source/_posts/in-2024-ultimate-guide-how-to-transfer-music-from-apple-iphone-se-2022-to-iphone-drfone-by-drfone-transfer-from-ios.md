## Part 3: Having Trouble When Transferring to iPhone 15 Stucks?

The issue of iPhone 15 getting stuck when users attempt to transfer data from their older devices, like the iPhone 14, to the new iPhone 15 has become a frustrating challenge for many Apple enthusiasts.

- **·Updating both devices to the latest iOS version**
- **·Ensuring sufficient storage**
- **·Seeking assistance from Apple Support**
- **·Authorized service providers when necessary**

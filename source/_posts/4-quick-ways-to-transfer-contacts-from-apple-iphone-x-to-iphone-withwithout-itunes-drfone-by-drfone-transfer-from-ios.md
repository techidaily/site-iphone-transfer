## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone X to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone X to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone X device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

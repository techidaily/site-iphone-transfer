## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

They create the issue with the free software and then they sting you to give you back your photos. Warn everybody you know. BEWARE._

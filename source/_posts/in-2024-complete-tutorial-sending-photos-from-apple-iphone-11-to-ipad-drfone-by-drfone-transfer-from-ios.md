## Part 2: How To Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 11 to PC With Cloud Storages

Cloud storage offers a bridge between devices that goes beyond physical limitations. It lets you move photos from your Apple iPhone 11  to your desktop computer. This section will explore some of the popular cloud storage platforms since both of them offer their unique set of features and advantages. Described below are two cloud storage services to **import photos from Apple iPhone 11 to PC**:

### Method 1: iCloud

iCloud is Apple's cloud storage service which seamlessly knits together the Apple ecosystem. It offers a harmonious blend of convenience and synchronization. The iCloud interface is intuitive and clean, making it accessible to all individuals. With iCloud, you can easily access your photos across devices in the Apple ecosystem. Use the following steps to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 11 to PC** via iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 11 , go to "Settings" and tap on your Apple ID. There, select "iCloud," tap "Photos," and toggle on "Sync This iPhone" on the next screen. This uploads your photos to iCloud.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- **Step 3:** Browse your photos and select the ones you want to transfer to your PC. Click the “Download” icon (cloud with arrow) to download the selected pictures to your PC.

![download the desired photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-8.jpg)

#### Pros

- iCloud can automatically back up your photos, ensuring that your memories are safeguarded in the event of device loss or damage.
- Your photos are accessible not only on your PC but also on your other Apple devices.

#### Con

- The provided 5GB of free cloud storage falls significantly short of meeting the requirements for adequate data backup.

### Method 2: Google Drive

In the vast realm of cloud storage solutions, Google Drive emerges as a universal storage for storing data. It is accessible on a multitude of devices and operating systems. This enables easy photo transfer between various platforms. You get 15GB of free storage with Google Drive to store and transfer your data. The steps needed to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 11 to PC** are given below:

- **Step 1:** Download the Google Drive app from the App Store and log in using your Google account credentials. Tap the "+" button and select "Upload" to add the targeted photos to Google Drive.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- **Step 2:** Once photos are uploaded, move to your PC and open Google Drive using a web browser. Locate the folder where you uploaded the pictures from your Apple iPhone 11 . Select the photos, right-click, and choose "Download" to initiate the download process.

![click on the download option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-10.jpg)

#### Pros

- Google Drive permits offline access to your synced photos, even without a constant internet connection.
- It allows you to selectively share photos and albums with specific individuals.

#### Con

- Unlike iCloud, which automatically backs up photos, you have to upload all images manually to Google Drive.

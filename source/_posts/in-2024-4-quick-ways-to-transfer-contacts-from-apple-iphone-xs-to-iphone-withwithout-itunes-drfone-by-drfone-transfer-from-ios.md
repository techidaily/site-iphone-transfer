## Everything You Need to Know About Shared Album

The Photos mobile application on iOS devices is a very powerful gallery software. It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone XS to iPhone.”

It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.

Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.

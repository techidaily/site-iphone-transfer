Moving data from one iPhone to another can be easier using Apple's tools. These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for **how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone**:

### Method 1. Quick Start

The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 13 Pro devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone** using Quick Start:

- **Step 1.** Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the "Set Up New iPhone" prompt appears, tap "Unlock to Continue." This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap "Continue" if you're comfortable with that.

## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

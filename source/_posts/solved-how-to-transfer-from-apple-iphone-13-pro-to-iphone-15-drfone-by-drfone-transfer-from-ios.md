If you're embedded in the Apple ecosystem, iCloud provides seamless integration of your iPhone Photos. Alternatively, Google Drive offers a cross-platform solution, enabling you to upload your iPhone photos to the cloud and access them on your computer browser.

For those who prefer a more traditional approach, iTunes provides a straightforward method via a USB connection. And if you're looking for a quick and versatile third-party solution, software like [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) simplifies the data transfer process with its user-friendly interface and robust features.

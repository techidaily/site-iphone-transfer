With eSIMs, the process of switching between devices is typically smoother compared to physical SIM cards. The reason is it involves digital activation and can be done remotely without the need to swap cards physically.

2. **Is there a difference between switching physical SIM cards and using eSIM for transferring phone services between Apple iPhone XR and other iPhones?**

Physical SIM cards are tangible, removable chips that need to be inserted into a SIM card tray, whereas eSIMs are integrated directly into the Apple iPhone XR device's hardware. Swapping physical SIM cards involves physically removing and inserting the card into the new device, whereas transferring an eSIM between devices can be done remotely. Physical SIM cards can store limited contact information and some network settings, whereas eSIMs can store multiple network profiles.

## Conclusion

This article has provided a valuable overview of **switching SIM cards to new Apple iPhone XR and other iPhones**. With a proper understanding of the repercussions involved in the process, a guide has been discussed. Along with its thorough discussion, you have also figured out how to transfer data to a new iPhone. For that, Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is the best option in the market.

For this process to complete, you need to import all songs from CD to iTunes at first. Here is the process for the complete transfer of Music from CD and other sources.

![transfer music from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPod - using cd step 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/transfer-music-from-iphone-to-ipod-5.jpg)

- Open iTunes and insert the CD that you wish to import into the disc drive
- The options might appear in an instant. If you want to import every song on the disc, select **yes** and click **No**, in case you want specific music to import.
- In case, you clicked on ‘NO’, Select the menu on the top-left side of the iTunes window and select the audio CD in the list.

- Then, check the files you want to import to iTunes, then select **Import CD**.
- The preferences option appears and you need to select the preferences and click OK after the preference has been done.
- In case, the music library already contains tracks from the album, which you are importing, you will receive a prompt window to overwrite them. You can select either **Replace Existing** or **Don’t Replace** as your wish.

- Then you have to wait till the music is ripped to the iTunes library.
- As soon as the import is complete, attach your device to the computer.
- You can now drag the album to the right side of the iTunes window where a pane will appear containing the music on your device. Drop it right on your iPod or other devices.

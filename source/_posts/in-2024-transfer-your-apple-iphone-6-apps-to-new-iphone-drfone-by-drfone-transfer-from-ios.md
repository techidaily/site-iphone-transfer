## Part 3: Having Trouble When Transferring to iPhone 15 Stucks?

The issue of iPhone 15 getting stuck when users attempt to transfer data from their older devices, like the iPhone 14, to the new iPhone 15 has become a frustrating challenge for many Apple enthusiasts. This problem often arises due to the complex nature of data migration and the high expectations associated with Apple's seamless ecosystem. When attempting to transfer photos, apps, contacts, and other vital information, users may encounter lengthy delays, frozen screens, or failed transfers.

The possible reasons could be:

- **·Software glitches**
- **·Insufficient storage space**
- **·Incompatible iOS versions between the old and new devices**

The impact of this issue extends beyond mere inconvenience, as it can result in data loss or a less-than-optimal out-of-the-box experience with the latest iPhone. Addressing this problem, you may try:

- **·Updating both devices to the latest iOS version**
- **·Ensuring sufficient storage**
- **·Seeking assistance from Apple Support**
- **·Authorized service providers when necessary**

Or, you can also try to ask for help from a third-party application, [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) is always at your service.

Cloud storage offers a bridge between devices that goes beyond physical limitations. It lets you move photos from your Apple iPhone 7 Plus  to your desktop computer. This section will explore some of the popular cloud storage platforms since both of them offer their unique set of features and advantages. Described below are two cloud storage services to **import photos from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to PC**:

### Method 1: iCloud

iCloud is Apple's cloud storage service which seamlessly knits together the Apple ecosystem. It offers a harmonious blend of convenience and synchronization. The iCloud interface is intuitive and clean, making it accessible to all individuals. With iCloud, you can easily access your photos across devices in the Apple ecosystem. Use the following steps to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to PC** via iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 7 Plus , go to "Settings" and tap on your Apple ID. There, select "iCloud," tap "Photos," and toggle on "Sync This iPhone" on the next screen. This uploads your photos to iCloud.

- Your photos are accessible not only on your PC but also on your other Apple devices.

#### Con

- The provided 5GB of free cloud storage falls significantly short of meeting the requirements for adequate data backup.

### Method 2: Google Drive

In the vast realm of cloud storage solutions, Google Drive emerges as a universal storage for storing data. It is accessible on a multitude of devices and operating systems. This enables easy photo transfer between various platforms. You get 15GB of free storage with Google Drive to store and transfer your data. The steps needed to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to PC** are given below:

![click on the download option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-10.jpg)

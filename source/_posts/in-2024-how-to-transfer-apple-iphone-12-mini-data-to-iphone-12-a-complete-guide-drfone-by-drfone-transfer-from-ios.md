## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 12 mini to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 12 mini to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

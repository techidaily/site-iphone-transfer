## Part 1: How To Sync Messages Between Two iOS Devices?

Synchronizing messages between two iOS devices is a convenient way.

It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is **how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone** via iCloud sync:

- **Step 1.** Ensure you're signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press "iCloud" to proceed.

## Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone Using iCloud Backup

Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can't restore messages selectively with this method. Here is **how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone** using iCloud backup:

- **Step 1.** Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open "Settings," tap on your name, and select "iCloud." Tap "iCloud Backup" and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.

## Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone via iTunes/Finder

Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone's data, including messages.

Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to **transfer messages from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone** via iTunes/Finder backup:

- **Step 1.** Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to access the "Summary" tab, while in Finder, access the "General" tab. Here, go to "Backups" and choose "Back Up Now" to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either "This Computer" (for iTunes) or "Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac" (for Finder).

When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn't go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device's functions to stop. Moreover, it's also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.

Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.

## **Part 2. What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?**

No doubt, refurbished iPhones are the same as the new ones. So, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the brand-new Apple iPhone 12 Pro at a lower price. If you are fine with a few scratches, refurbished iPhones have a lot more to offer you. The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone 12 Pro are as follows:

- **Cost Savings**

One of the major benefits of purchasing a refurbished Apple iPhone 12 Pro is the cost savings. These devices are more affordable than brand-new ones. You can enjoy the latest features without breaking the bank.

- **Quality Assurance**

Refurbished iPhones are carefully inspected and tested to ensure that they meet Apple's high standards. They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone 12 Pro will look and perform like a new iPhone.

- **Environmental Friendly**

When you get a refurbished item, you're giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that's awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.

![An illustration of eco-friendly technology.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png)

- **Warranty and Support**

Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.

On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 12 Pro from a private seller, make sure that it's not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.

Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:

1. **Seller Reputation**

Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple's official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.

**Compatibility**

Ensure the used Apple iPhone 12 Pro you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.

**Storage**

Choose the Apple iPhone 12 Pro model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.

**Warranty Coverage**

Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty's duration and what it covers.

**Condition and History**

Ask questions about the phone's condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.

**Return Policy**

Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.

**Original Accessories**

Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 12 Pro comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.

**Price Comparison**

Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you're getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.

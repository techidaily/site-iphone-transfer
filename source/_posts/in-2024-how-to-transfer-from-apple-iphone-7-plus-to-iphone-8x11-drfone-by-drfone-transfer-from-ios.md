### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Tap "Send" to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won't be added directly. To save the contact, tap "Create New Contact," write any contact details, and select "Done" to finish saving the contact.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

This section will explore some of the popular cloud storage platforms since both of them offer their unique set of features and advantages. Described below are two cloud storage services to **import photos from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to PC**:

### Method 1: iCloud

iCloud is Apple's cloud storage service which seamlessly knits together the Apple ecosystem. It offers a harmonious blend of convenience and synchronization. The iCloud interface is intuitive and clean, making it accessible to all individuals. With iCloud, you can easily access your photos across devices in the Apple ecosystem. Use the following steps to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to PC** via iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 7 Plus , go to "Settings" and tap on your Apple ID. There, select "iCloud," tap "Photos," and toggle on "Sync This iPhone" on the next screen. This uploads your photos to iCloud.

![enable icloud photos sync feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-6.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Move to your computer and on your Windows PC, open a web browser, and go to the iCloud website. Log in with your Apple ID and password and click the "Photos" icon to access your iCloud Photo Library.

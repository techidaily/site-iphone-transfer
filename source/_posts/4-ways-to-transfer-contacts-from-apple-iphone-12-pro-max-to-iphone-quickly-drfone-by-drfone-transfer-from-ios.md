## Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes \[iPhone 15 Included\]

Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data. In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:

**Step 1:** To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the "Phone" icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the "Summary" tab. Then, navigate to the "Backups" section and check the "This Computer" option. Then, hit the "Back Up Now" button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.

It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry.

On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.

## FAQS

1. **How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone 8 to Samsung?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated "WhatsApp Transfer" feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the "WhatsApp Transfer" option, and initiate the transfer.

2. **Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

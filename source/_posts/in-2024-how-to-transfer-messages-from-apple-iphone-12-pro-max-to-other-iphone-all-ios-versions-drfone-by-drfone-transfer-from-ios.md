The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone's data, including messages.

Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to **transfer messages from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone** via iTunes/Finder backup:

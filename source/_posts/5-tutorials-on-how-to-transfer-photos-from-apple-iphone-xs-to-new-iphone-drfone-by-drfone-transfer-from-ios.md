The Photos mobile application on iOS devices is a very powerful gallery software. It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry.

On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder.

**Sync Contacts and Backup**

Now you need to take your source iPhone and go to the Settings option. Then you need to tap the name at the top, go to the iCloud option, scroll down and make sure the option for Contact is toggled on. If you have iOS 10.2 and earlier on your phone, you will find it in Settings > iCloud.

After syncing the contacts, you need to scroll down to the iCloud Backup option and choose the Backup Now option.

**Refresh Contacts**

Ensure that the syncing contact option on your target iPhone is enabled from the settings option, and then open the contact app to swipe down and refresh it. Within a very short time, your contacts will start appearing on your target iPhone.

## Part 3. Sync contacts from Apple iPhone XS to iPhone Including iPhone 15 by iCloud syncing

You can easily learn how to transfer contacts from one iPhone to another (like iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro) using iCloud syncing. It takes very little time, and all it needs is one apple account signed in to both your source and target iPhones at a time. Just follow these steps properly-

**Merge Contacts**

You need to go to the “Settings” option of your source iPhone and tap on your name at the top of the settings screen. Check the “Contacts” option is toggled on or not from the “iCloud” option. After that, hit merge to upload your contacts on iCloud.

![transfer contacts from iphone to iphone using icloud sync](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/03/transfer-contacts-to-iphone-using-icloud-3.jpg)

You need to use the Apple ID and password on your target phone and do the same thing to toggle on the “Contacts” option from “iCloud” and wait until your iPhone asks you to merge contacts.

**Refresh Contacts**

After choosing the “Merge” option, you will see that existing contacts and previous contacts from the source iPhone will merge on your target iPhone. Now you need to refresh the contact list, which will allow you to find all the old contacts to your target iPhone.

## Part 4. Move Contacts from Apple iPhone XS to iPhone Including iPhone 15 using iTunes

iTunes is a great solution to transfer iPhone contacts. Many users prefer iTunes while transferring contacts because it comes directly from Apple, and it takes care of all your iOS device management needs. These steps will help you to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS to iPhone using iTunes-

**Install iTunes and connect source iPhone**

Download the latest version of iTunes on your PC, install it properly, and launch the software. Connect your source iPhone to your PC, and iTunes will automatically detect it.

**Backup Contacts**

Now click on the “Device” option and then select iPhone. Then you need to select the “Summary” option and then choose “This Computer” and “Back Up Now” to back up all your data and contacts on your PC.

**Restore Backup**

In the end, you need to connect your target iPhone to your PC and choose the “Summary” option in the iTunes software. You need to choose the “Restore Backup” option and then browse and select the latest backup folder. At last, choose the “Restore” option. iTunes transfers contacts and all the data from the source iPhone to target the iPhone, and it’s essential to back up the data from your source iPhone.

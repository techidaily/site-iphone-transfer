## Part 1: How To Sync Messages Between Two iOS Devices?

Synchronizing messages between two iOS devices is a convenient way.

## Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone XR to iPhone via iTunes/Finder

Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone's data, including messages.

Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to **transfer messages from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone** via iTunes/Finder backup:

- **Step 1.** Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone XR device to access the "Summary" tab, while in Finder, access the "General" tab. Here, go to "Backups" and choose "Back Up Now" to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either "This Computer" (for iTunes) or "Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac" (for Finder).

![create backup in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-8.jpg)

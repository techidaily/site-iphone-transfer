Step 1. Do not set up your new iPhone 8/11/11 Pro. If you already have, Visit **“Settings” > “General” > “Reset”** > Erase all content and settings to start from scratch.

Step 2. Now on your old Phone 5s, visit “**Settings**” and tap on your name. Select “**iCloud**” and scroll down to select “**iCloud Backup**” and hit “**Backup Now**”. Let the process finish completely and note down the exact timing of the back up file.

Step 3. Now, on the iPhone 8/11/11 Pro, start setting it up once again and connect it to a WiFi network.

Step 4. Once you reach the “Set Up” Page, select “**Restore from iCloud backup**” .

Step 5. Select the most recent back up file. Feed in your Apple ID details and let the iPhone restore all the data from iCloud backup. Let your iPhone 8/11/11 Pro reboot at the end of restoration process.

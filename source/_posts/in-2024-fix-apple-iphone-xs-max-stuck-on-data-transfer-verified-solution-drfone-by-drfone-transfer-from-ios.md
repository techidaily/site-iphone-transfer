## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone XS Max Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone XS Max to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone XS Max to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone XS Max using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

### **4\. Problem in the iOS Version**

## Part 2: Transfer photos from Android to iPhone including iPhone 15/15 Pro(Max) using Move to iOS App?

Now, to answer how to transfer photos from Android to iPhone, there is another simple solution that you can make use of. It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.

Note: This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App.

Now to proceed, first of all, you need to do some settings on your iPhone device as follows:

On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps & Data’ > choose ‘Move Data from Android’ option.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

The next step is to take your Apple iPhone XS Max to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- Switch to your Apple iPhone XS Max, open Google Play Store, and search for ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
- At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android device.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move from android to ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-8.jpg)

- On your Apple iPhone XS Max, enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-enrer the code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-9.jpg)

Before the transfer starts, you will be asked a number of questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only want videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll’

The above process to transfer pictures from Android to iPhone is good for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.

## Part 3: How to transfer photos from Android to iPhone using Google Drive?

Google Drive is cloud storage that is available to those who have a Gmail address. It can store anything ranging from Word Documents to photos and videos. Hence, if you are wondering how to move photos from Android to iPhone, then Google Drive is your answer.

To go with the transfer of photos and videos from Android to iPhone with Google Drive, follow the steps outlined below:

- First, make sure Google Drive is already installed on the Android device. If not, visit the Play Store to download Google drive. Then, on your Apple iPhone XS Max, visit the Gallery section> select the images> tap on Share button> and finally choose Share via Drive.

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice.

Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

After installing this Android app, you can download iCloud data to your ZTE directly, or connect iPhone to ZTE for data transfer using an iPhone-to-Android adapter._

Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer makes it so easy, all you need is to simply install this software utility and then connect both phones to a PC. Both phones must however be connected at the same time in order for this service to work. This means that you cannot back up contents from your iOS device to transfer at a later time. This problem is however negated by the fact that it will take a very short time to transfer everything, so there is no need to back-up anything.

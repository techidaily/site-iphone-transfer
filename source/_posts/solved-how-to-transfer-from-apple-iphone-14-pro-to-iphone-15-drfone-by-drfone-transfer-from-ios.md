## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

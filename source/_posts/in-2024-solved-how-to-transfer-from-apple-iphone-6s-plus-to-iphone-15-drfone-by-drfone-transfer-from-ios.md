<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files.

However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro or tablet.

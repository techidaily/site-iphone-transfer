iTunes, iCloud and Dr.Fone are few of the methods which tend to enable the **transfer data from old iPhone to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11**. However, considering the complexity of the iTunes and iCloud, we'd urge the readers if they can try the Dr.Fone at least once. It is not only easy but also less time consuming. It prevents the additional steps such as backup and restore settings. Rather, the entire process is done with just one click. Dr.Fone is highly user friendly and a bit different from traditional ways of transfer data Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11.

We know the emotions and sentiments attached with one’s personal information and thus we have tried to give users a platform, where they can make the transition from one phone to another extremely simple. Simply download and have a try.

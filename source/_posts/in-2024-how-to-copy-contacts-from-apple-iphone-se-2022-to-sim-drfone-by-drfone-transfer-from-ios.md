### Save your contacts to iCloud

By default, every user gets a free space of 5 GB on iCloud (which can later be expanded). Therefore, you can easily take a backup of your contacts and other important files on iCloud. Just go to your device’s Settings > iCloud and turn the backup option on. Make sure that the backup for Contacts is turned on as well. This will sync your contacts to iCloud, letting you access them on the go. In this way, you don’t have to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to SIM.

### Export iPhone contacts Via iTunes

Simply connect your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to the system and launch iTunes. Select your iPhone and go to its “Info” tab. From here, you can sync its contacts with iTunes.

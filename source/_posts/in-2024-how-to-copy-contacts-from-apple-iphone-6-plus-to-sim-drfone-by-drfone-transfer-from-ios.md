You don’t have to follow any kind of confusing or long process and it’s really simple if you follow the guideline properly. If you don’t want to use any third-party software or app to move data from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Samsung, then you can follow the below guidelines to transfer data manually.

1. For this process, at first, you need 2 lightning USB cables. You need to connect both of your devices to your PC.
2. Now you will see a pop-up on both devices and you need to tap on the “Trust” button to trust the PC on both devices.
3. Next, you need to enter your iPhone folder from your PC and copy all the files/folders that you want to transfer.
4. After that, you need to go to your Samsung device folder and choose any folder to paste all the copied files from your iPhone.

## FAQS

1. **How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Samsung?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated "WhatsApp Transfer" feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the "WhatsApp Transfer" option, and initiate the transfer. Dr.Fone efficiently moves WhatsApp chats, messages, and media from your iPhone to the Samsung device, ensuring a seamless transition of your conversations without compromising data integrity.

2. **Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?**

Before transitioning from an iPhone to a non-Apple device, such as a Samsung phone, it is recommended to disable iMessage. This step is crucial as it prevents text messages intended for your phone number from being directed solely through iMessage. By deactivating iMessage, you facilitate the reception of SMS messages on your new Samsung device without any interference.

3. **What if I face issues during the transfer process?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

- Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.
- Verify for any pending software updates on both devices and proceed with their installation if available.
- Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.
- For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.

4. **Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?**

Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.

Learning about the iPhone to Samsung transfer is easy when you have a clear and precise guideline. With the help of this article, you will not only be able to transfer data from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Samsung but also completely switch your device in a very short time. These 6 methods can help you solve all your confusion on how to switch from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to Samsung easily. But if you ask me which method is the best for you that can ensure a 100% successful transfer and no data loss during the process, then I would blindly suggest you use Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer. This amazing software can simply transfer all types of data from your old iPhone device to your new Samsung device. There is no other software or app that can give you so many options in just 1 click! So if you have already become fed up trying a whole lot of software and apps or you are confused about choosing a third-party transfer app, then you should choose Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer for this.

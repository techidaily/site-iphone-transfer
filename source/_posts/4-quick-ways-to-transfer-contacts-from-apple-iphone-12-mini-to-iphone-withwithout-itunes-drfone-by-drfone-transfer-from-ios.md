## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 12 mini Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 12 mini to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone 12 mini to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone 12 mini using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

### **4\. Problem in the iOS Version**

When performing iPhone-to-iPhone data transfer, ensure that both iPhones are free from any iOS bugs. For this purpose, update your older iPhone to the latest iOS version to avoid bugs and glitches. If you are using the iOS 17 Beta version on your old iPhone, it can also cause this issue.

## Method 2. Transfer Data One by One from Apple iPhone 12 mini to Android for Free

Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone 12 mini to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 12 mini to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it's impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 12 mini or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 12 mini to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 12 mini or tablet.

### Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 12 mini to Android via iCloud

When switching from Apple iPhone 12 mini to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts.

That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

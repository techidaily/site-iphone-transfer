### Method 2: Transfer iTunes Data to Samsung

If you have backed up your iPhone data in iTunes, you can restore it to your Samsung device. The “Phone Manager” feature in Dr.Fone allows you to restore iTunes data on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. This tool can transfer media files, social data, mobile apps, contacts, and more. Let's explore the steps involved in **transferring data from an iPhone to a Samsung** device using iTunes:

### **Step 1: Activate Dr.Fone and Connect Samsung Device**

First, access the Wondershare Dr.Fone software and connect your Samsung device to your system. The device will appear on the left side that you will select to access the homepage. There, choose the “iTunes Library” option to proceed further.

- **Step 2: Select and Export the Specific File Types**

The new window will open, and you must select the “Export iTunes Media to Device” option. This will enable the transfer of iTunes media to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. After that, you need to checkmark the file types to transfer and hit the "Transfer" button.

### Method 3: Transfer iCloud Data to Samsung

iCloud serves as a highly convenient method to back up iOS devices. However, restoring an iCloud backup to Android devices is not as simple. iCloud only allows restoring the entire backup to iOS device setup, and it doesn't support restoring backups to Android devices. The iCloud Manager feature in Wondershare Dr.Fone offers a solution to address this limitation.

It allows selective content restoration from iCloud backups to Samsung devices without alteration. Learn how to **transfer from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Samsung** via iCloud backup data with the help of the following steps:

- **Step 1: Access Wondershare Dr.Fone and Plugin Samsung Device**

To begin with, open the Wondershare Dr.Fone software on your system and connect your Samsung device to it. Then, access your device on the software from the left side and select the "iCloud Manager" option within the home screen. You have to fill in those credentials to sign into your iCloud account.

- **Step 2: Select the Data Files and Start Restoration**

In the next step, you have to select the data type from your iCloud backed-up data. Then, hit the "Restore to Device" button and the "Start" button to start the restoration process. The progress bar will appear and display the progress of the restoration of iCloud data to Samsung devices.

## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

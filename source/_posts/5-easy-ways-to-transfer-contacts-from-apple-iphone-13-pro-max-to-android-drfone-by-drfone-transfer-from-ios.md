**Step 3:** Finally, hit the “Start Transfer” button to begin the transfer and that’s it.

And if you ever want to get back to your iPhone, then you would probably wonder how to switch from Pixel to iPhone. In that case, all you need is a phone-to-phone data transfer app like Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer to make the switch successful with all the data you need on your new device.



## The Bottom Line

Switching between the iPhone and Google Pixel demands thoughtful deliberation, as evidenced by the ongoing debate. Factors like OS preferences, app compatibility, and data synchronization need to be considered. While the transition process may seem daunting, many tools can simplify the switch. They ensure a smooth experience of switching from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Google Pixel.

In this context, Wondershare Dr.Fone emerges as a comprehensive and user-friendly solution. It helps you in transferring data from an iPhone to a Google Pixel. With its versatile data transfer capabilities and emphasis on data security, Dr.Fone offers a reliable and efficient data transfer method.

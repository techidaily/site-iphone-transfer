## Part 3: How to Transfer Everything from Apple iPhone 13 to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 with iCloud

iCould is another software which also enables the transfer of data from Apple iPhone 13 to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11. In order to transfer data Apple iPhone 13 to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 using iCloud, you can consider the following steps to make the process easy.

1. Just like iTunes, with iCloud too you need to back up your data to iCloud so that it can be restored to your new iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11. In order to back up, first you need to connect the Apple iPhone 13 device to the Wi-Fi network. Then go to the setting, click on iCloud button and then click on to iCloud backup. You need to check whether the iCloud backup is turned on or not. Make sure it is turned on. Click on "**back up now**". Keep your phone connected to Wi-Fi until the process is completed.

1. The application will ask for the backup. Once you've checked that the backup is correct you can click on it.
2. Make sure your device is connected to it until the process is completed.

iTunes, iCloud and Dr.Fone are few of the methods which tend to enable the **transfer data from old iPhone to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11**. However, considering the complexity of the iTunes and iCloud, we'd urge the readers if they can try the Dr.Fone at least once. It is not only easy but also less time consuming. It prevents the additional steps such as backup and restore settings. Rather, the entire process is done with just one click. Dr.Fone is highly user friendly and a bit different from traditional ways of transfer data Apple iPhone 13 to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11.

We know the emotions and sentiments attached with one’s personal information and thus we have tried to give users a platform, where they can make the transition from one phone to another extremely simple. Simply download and have a try.

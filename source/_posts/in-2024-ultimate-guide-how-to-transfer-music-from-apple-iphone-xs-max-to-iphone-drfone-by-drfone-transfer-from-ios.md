## Part 2: Notice That You Should Know Before Switching from iPhone To Google Pixel

Before you switch iPhone to Pixel 2, there are certain things to consider or you need to do, so let’s have a look at them-

### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.

![disable-imessage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-imessage.jpg)

### 2- You Might Need to Buy Your Apps Again

Have you pay-front apps on your iDevice that you paid for? If so, then you’ll probably need to purchase them again from the Google Play Store if you want those apps on your Google Pixel phone as well. The App Store and Google Play Store are entirely different entities and the housed apps are designed for different platforms. Some apps you had on your iDevice may not even be accessible for your Google Pixel device and vice-versa. However, if you’ve subscribed to a service such as Spotify, you just have to get the app and sign in to your new Android device and that’s it.

### 3- Re-Sync Your Crucial Data

If you have all of your calendar events, contacts, documents, and photos synced with iCloud and all is on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to re-sync all on your Google Pixel device. Android’s cloud version is housed in Google apps such as Gmail, Contacts, Docs, Drive, etc. When you set up your Google Pixel, you’ll create and set up a Google account. From this point, you can sync some of the iCloud content with the Google account, thus you won’t need to re-enter lots of info.

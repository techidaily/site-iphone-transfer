### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device's data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

- **Step 2:** Move to the "Backups" section on iTunes/Finder and click "Back Up Now." Before this, confirm the selection of "This Computer" in iTunes and for Finder" or "Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac."

### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Tap "Send" to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won't be added directly. To save the contact, tap "Create New Contact," write any contact details, and select "Done" to finish saving the contact.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.

Some apps you had on your iDevice may not even be accessible for your Google Pixel device and vice-versa. However, if you’ve subscribed to a service such as Spotify, you just have to get the app and sign in to your new Android device and that’s it.

### 3- Re-Sync Your Crucial Data

If you have all of your calendar events, contacts, documents, and photos synced with iCloud and all is on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to re-sync all on your Google Pixel device. Android’s cloud version is housed in Google apps such as Gmail, Contacts, Docs, Drive, etc. When you set up your Google Pixel, you’ll create and set up a Google account. From this point, you can sync some of the iCloud content with the Google account, thus you won’t need to re-enter lots of info.

**Step 3:** Finally, hit the “Start Transfer” button to begin the transfer and that’s it.

And if you ever want to get back to your iPhone, then you would probably wonder how to switch from Pixel to iPhone. In that case, all you need is a phone-to-phone data transfer app like Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer to make the switch successful with all the data you need on your new device.



## The Bottom Line

They ensure a smooth experience of switching from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Google Pixel.

In this context, Wondershare Dr.Fone emerges as a comprehensive and user-friendly solution. It helps you in transferring data from an iPhone to a Google Pixel.

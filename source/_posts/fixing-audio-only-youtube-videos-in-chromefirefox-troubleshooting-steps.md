 While you’re browsing the Internet on your computer, your system starts freezing for a few seconds, then resumes normally and then again freezes. When you open Task Manager, it shows Google Chrome using a high percentage of your CPU. You may wonder how come Chrome is eating so much of your CPU — there’re many possible causes for Chrome high CPU usage, but there are also many possible solutions…

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 solutions that have helped many other users fix their Chrome high CPU usage problem. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

### Fix 2: Disable unnecessary extensions

 Chrome extensions are also known to cause Chrome high system resource usage, such as 100% CPU, memory or disk usage. If you’ve installed a number of Chrome extensions, they may be the culprit for Chrome high CPU usage. We recommend disabling or deleting them one by one. Then restart Chrome and see if Chrome high CPU usage is fixed.

1. Type`**chrome://extensions**` in the URL bar and press**Enter** to open the Chrome extension manager, where Chrome extensions are installed.

2. **Toggle off** all extensions to disable them.

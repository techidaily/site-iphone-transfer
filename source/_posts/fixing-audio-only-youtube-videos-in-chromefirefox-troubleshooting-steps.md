### Fix 2: Disable unnecessary extensions

 Chrome extensions are also known to cause Chrome high system resource usage, such as 100% CPU, memory or disk usage. If you’ve installed a number of Chrome extensions, they may be the culprit for Chrome high CPU usage. We recommend disabling or deleting them one by one. Then restart Chrome and see if Chrome high CPU usage is fixed.

1. Type`**chrome://extensions**` in the URL bar and press**Enter** to open the Chrome extension manager, where Chrome extensions are installed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bece0cbe3af4.png)
2. **Toggle off** all extensions to disable them.

### Fix 1: Free up drive space

 If your C: drive is less than 2 GB, freeing space would help drop the CPU usage. As soon as the free space is more than 2 GB, you’ll see the difference. Click to learn[how to free up drive space](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
 This is also the reason why clearing disk cache and cookies would work.  
 Here’s how to clear cache and cookies in Chrome:

1. Open Chrome, and then press**Ctrl + Shift + Del** on your keyboard.
2. From the**Basic** tab, set the**Time range** to**All time** , and select all the checkboxes below.![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chrome-Clear-cache1.jpg)

### Fix 2: Disable unnecessary extensions

 Chrome extensions are also known to cause Chrome high system resource usage, such as 100% CPU, memory or disk usage. If you’ve installed a number of Chrome extensions, they may be the culprit for Chrome high CPU usage. We recommend disabling or deleting them one by one. Then restart Chrome and see if Chrome high CPU usage is fixed.

1. Type`**chrome://extensions**` in the URL bar and press**Enter** to open the Chrome extension manager, where Chrome extensions are installed.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bece0cbe3af4.png)
2. **Toggle off** all extensions to disable them.

3. Restart Chrome and test if the issue is fixed. If not, move on to Solution 3, below.

### Fix 3: Reset Chrome settings to default

 Resetting Chrome to its default settings is another useful solution to Chrome high CPU usage. This rules out all man-made causes. You can follow these steps to reset Chrome settings to default:

1. At the top right in Chrome, click the**three dots** \>**Settings** .

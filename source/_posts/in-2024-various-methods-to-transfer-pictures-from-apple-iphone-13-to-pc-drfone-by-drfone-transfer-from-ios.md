- Your photos are accessible not only on your PC but also on your other Apple devices.

#### Con

- The provided 5GB of free cloud storage falls significantly short of meeting the requirements for adequate data backup.

### Method 2: Google Drive

In the vast realm of cloud storage solutions, Google Drive emerges as a universal storage for storing data. It is accessible on a multitude of devices and operating systems. This enables easy photo transfer between various platforms. You get 15GB of free storage with Google Drive to store and transfer your data. The steps needed to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 13 to PC** are given below:

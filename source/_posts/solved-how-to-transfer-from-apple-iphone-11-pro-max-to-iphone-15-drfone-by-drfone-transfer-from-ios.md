<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device's data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Move to the "Backups" section on iTunes/Finder and click "Back Up Now." Before this, confirm the selection of "This Computer" in iTunes and for Finder" or "Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac."

### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Tap "Send" to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won't be added directly.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

### Method 3: Transfer iCloud Data to Samsung

iCloud serves as a highly convenient method to back up iOS devices. However, restoring an iCloud backup to Android devices is not as simple. iCloud only allows restoring the entire backup to iOS device setup, and it doesn't support restoring backups to Android devices. The iCloud Manager feature in Wondershare Dr.Fone offers a solution to address this limitation.

It allows selective content restoration from iCloud backups to Samsung devices without alteration. Learn how to **transfer from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Samsung** via iCloud backup data with the help of the following steps:

- **Step 1: Access Wondershare Dr.Fone and Plugin Samsung Device**

To begin with, open the Wondershare Dr.Fone software on your system and connect your Samsung device to it. Then, access your device on the software from the left side and select the "iCloud Manager" option within the home screen. You have to fill in those credentials to sign into your iCloud account.

- **Step 2: Select the Data Files and Start Restoration**

In the next step, you have to select the data type from your iCloud backed-up data. Then, hit the "Restore to Device" button and the "Start" button to start the restoration process. The progress bar will appear and display the progress of the restoration of iCloud data to Samsung devices.

## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We‚Äôre expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

## Conclusion

In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to **transfer from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Samsung.** However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users. We have provided you with a more effective and powerful solution: Wondershare Dr.Fone. This tool will assist you in **transferring your iPhone to Samsung** with just one click. Plus, you learned about the latest Samsung devices in this article.

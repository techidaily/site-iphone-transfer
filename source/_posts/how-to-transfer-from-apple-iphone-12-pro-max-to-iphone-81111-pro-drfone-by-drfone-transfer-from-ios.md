## Part 3: How Many Data Can I Email To Google Pixel?

Thinking about transferring data from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to Google Pixel by Email? Well, it is the best option only if you want to transfer small-size files and not much data. And yes, there is a limit to how many or much data can you email to your new Google Pixel device.

The email size limit is 20 MB for some platforms and 25 megabytes for others. For instance, if you want to send a video from your iPhone to your new Google Pixel device, then the video should be less than 15 or 20 seconds long to share via email.

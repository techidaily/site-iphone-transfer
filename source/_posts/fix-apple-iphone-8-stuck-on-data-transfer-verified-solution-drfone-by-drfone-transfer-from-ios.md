## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 8 Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 8 to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone 8 to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone 8 using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

### **4\. Problem in the iOS Version**

When performing iPhone-to-iPhone data transfer, ensure that both iPhones are free from any iOS bugs. For this purpose, update your older iPhone to the latest iOS version to avoid bugs and glitches. If you are using the iOS 17 Beta version on your old iPhone, it can also cause this issue.

## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### 5\. Compatibility Issues

Older iPhone models might not support the latest iOS versions or certain features. It leads to compatibility issues when transferring data between devices. This is a prominent issue when dealing with different iOS versions.

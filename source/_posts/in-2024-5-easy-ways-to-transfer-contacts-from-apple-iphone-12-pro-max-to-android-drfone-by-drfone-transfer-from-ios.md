- Open iTunes and insert the CD that you wish to import into the disc drive
- The options might appear in an instant. If you want to import every song on the disc, select **yes** and click **No**, in case you want specific music to import.
- In case, you clicked on ‘NO’, Select the menu on the top-left side of the iTunes window and select the audio CD in the list.

- Then, check the files you want to import to iTunes, then select **Import CD**.
- The preferences option appears and you need to select the preferences and click OK after the preference has been done.
- In case, the music library already contains tracks from the album, which you are importing, you will receive a prompt window to overwrite them. You can select either **Replace Existing** or **Don’t Replace** as your wish.

- Then you have to wait till the music is ripped to the iTunes library.
- As soon as the import is complete, attach your device to the computer.
- You can now drag the album to the right side of the iTunes window where a pane will appear containing the music on your device. Drop it right on your iPod or other devices.

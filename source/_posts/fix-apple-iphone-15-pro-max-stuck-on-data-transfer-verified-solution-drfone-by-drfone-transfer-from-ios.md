## Part 2: Notice That You Should Know Before Switching from iPhone To Google Pixel

Before you switch iPhone to Pixel 2, there are certain things to consider or you need to do, so let’s have a look at them-

### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.

![disable-imessage](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-imessage.jpg)

### 2- You Might Need to Buy Your Apps Again

Have you pay-front apps on your iDevice that you paid for? If so, then you’ll probably need to purchase them again from the Google Play Store if you want those apps on your Google Pixel phone as well. The App Store and Google Play Store are entirely different entities and the housed apps are designed for different platforms. Some apps you had on your iDevice may not even be accessible for your Google Pixel device and vice-versa. However, if you’ve subscribed to a service such as Spotify, you just have to get the app and sign in to your new Android device and that’s it.

### 3- Re-Sync Your Crucial Data

If you have all of your calendar events, contacts, documents, and photos synced with iCloud and all is on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to re-sync all on your Google Pixel device. Android’s cloud version is housed in Google apps such as Gmail, Contacts, Docs, Drive, etc. When you set up your Google Pixel, you’ll create and set up a Google account. From this point, you can sync some of the iCloud content with the Google account, thus you won’t need to re-enter lots of info.

## Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes \[iPhone 15 Included\]

Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data. In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:

**Step 1:** To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the "Phone" icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the "Summary" tab. Then, navigate to the "Backups" section and check the "This Computer" option. Then, hit the "Back Up Now" button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.

![tap back up now button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the "Backups" section in the "Summary" tab. Here, tap "Restore Backup" and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap "Restore" and wait for the backup to be restored.

## Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop \[iPhone 15 Included\]

AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner. Unlike iCloud or iTunes, it does not need to sync all the photos. You just have to select the photos from one of your iPhones and AirDrop them to another. However, the other iPhone should be within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range of the host iDevice. Here are the instructions you need to follow to AirDrop photos from old iPhone to new iPhone efficiently:

**Step 1:** On your old iPhone, you need to open the "Photos" app and hop into the desired folder. Next, pick the photos you want to share by tapping the "Select" button in the upper right corner.

**Step 2:** Following this, you will have to tap the “Share” icon, followed by selecting the targeted “AirDrop” recipient iPhone. Then, on the target iPhone, you have to choose “Accept” to receive them.

![press the accept button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg)

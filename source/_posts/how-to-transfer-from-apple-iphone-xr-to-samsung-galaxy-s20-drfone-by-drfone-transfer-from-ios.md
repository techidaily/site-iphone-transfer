### Copy iPhone Contacts Using Gmail

Just like iCloud, you can also sync your contacts with Gmail. If you don’t use Gmail, then go to your iPhone’s Accounts Settings and set up your Gmail account. Later, you can go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Gmail and toggle on the syncing option for Contacts.

If you want, you can access your Google Contacts and import them to a vCard as well. This would be a perfect alternative to learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone XR to SIM.

We hope this guide was able to answer your question of how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to SIM. Since there is no ideal solution for it, you can try different alternatives. Dr.Fone Backup & Restore is one of the best ways to keep your contacts (and other types of data) safe and will certainly save the day during an emergency situation.

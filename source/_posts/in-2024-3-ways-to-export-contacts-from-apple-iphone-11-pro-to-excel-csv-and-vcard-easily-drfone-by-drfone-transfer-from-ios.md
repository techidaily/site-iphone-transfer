You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?

![A picture of a second-hand iPhone.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png)

In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones. What are they, and how they can be a budget-friendly alternative? We will answer everything you need to know.

But before starting, let’s shed some light on what refurbished iPhones actually are because some people aren’t aware of this term.

## **Part 1. What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro mean?**

Before going further, let's clarify what exactly a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro is. In simple words, you can say that it is a device that has gone through a series of checks and repairs. So that it can work the same way as a brand-new Apple iPhone 11 Pro does. If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.

When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn't go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device's functions to stop. Moreover, it's also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.

Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.

## **Part 2. What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?**

No doubt, refurbished iPhones are the same as the new ones. So, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the brand-new Apple iPhone 11 Pro at a lower price. If you are fine with a few scratches, refurbished iPhones have a lot more to offer you. The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone 11 Pro are as follows:

- **Cost Savings**

One of the major benefits of purchasing a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro is the cost savings. These devices are more affordable than brand-new ones. You can enjoy the latest features without breaking the bank.

![An illustration of saving cost.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-2.png)

- **Quality Assurance**

Refurbished iPhones are carefully inspected and tested to ensure that they meet Apple's high standards. They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro will look and perform like a new iPhone.

- **Environmental Friendly**

When you get a refurbished item, you're giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that's awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.

![An illustration of eco-friendly technology.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png)

- **Warranty and Support**

## **Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?**

Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.

On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro from a private seller, make sure that it's not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.

It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.

## **Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.**

Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:

1. **Seller Reputation**

Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple's official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.

**Compatibility**

Ensure the used Apple iPhone 11 Pro you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.

**Storage**

Choose the Apple iPhone 11 Pro model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.

**Warranty Coverage**

Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty's duration and what it covers.

**Condition and History**

Ask questions about the phone's condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.

**Return Policy**

Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.

**Original Accessories**

Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 11 Pro comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.

**Price Comparison**

Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you're getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.

## FAQS

1. **How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung?**

Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated "WhatsApp Transfer" feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the "WhatsApp Transfer" option, and initiate the transfer. Dr.Fone efficiently moves WhatsApp chats, messages, and media from your iPhone to the Samsung device, ensuring a seamless transition of your conversations without compromising data integrity.

2. **Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?**

Before transitioning from an iPhone to a non-Apple device, such as a Samsung phone, it is recommended to disable iMessage. This step is crucial as it prevents text messages intended for your phone number from being directed solely through iMessage. By deactivating iMessage, you facilitate the reception of SMS messages on your new Samsung device without any interference.

3. **What if I face issues during the transfer process?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

- Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.
- Verify for any pending software updates on both devices and proceed with their installation if available.
- Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.
- For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.

4. **Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?**

Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.

Learning about the iPhone to Samsung transfer is easy when you have a clear and precise guideline. With the help of this article, you will not only be able to transfer data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung but also completely switch your device in a very short time.

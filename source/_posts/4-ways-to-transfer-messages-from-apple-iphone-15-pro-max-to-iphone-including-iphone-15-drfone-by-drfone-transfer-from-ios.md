It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry.

On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder.

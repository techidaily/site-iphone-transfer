<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 6s device for these methods to work.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### 5\. Compatibility Issues

Older iPhone models might not support the latest iOS versions or certain features. It leads to compatibility issues when transferring data between devices. This is a prominent issue when dealing with different iOS versions.

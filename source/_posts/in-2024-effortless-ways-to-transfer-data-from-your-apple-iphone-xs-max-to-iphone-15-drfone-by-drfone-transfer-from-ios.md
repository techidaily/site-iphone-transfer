**Issues about transferring data from Apple iPhone XS Max to Motorola G5/G5Plus**

One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.

For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

However, even if your PC is using other operating systems, such as Windows, you can still use iCloud for Windows to save and transfer your iPhone photos from iCloud.

How to **transfer iPhone photos to a computer** using iCloud:

**Step 1:** Make sure you have synced iCloud photos on your iPhone.

On your iPhone Settings, go to your profile and tap iCloud. Then, select Photos and turn on the switch next to “Sync this \[device\].” Otherwise, go to iCloud settings > iCloud Drive, and switch on “Sync this iPhone.”

## **Part 3: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with iTunes**

You can also make the most of iTunes to secure your iPhone with backups, keep it up-to-date, or synchronize content between your iOS device and your computer in both directions. Even if you're a Windows PC user, there's no need to fret. Although iTunes is an Apple product, it’s also available for Windows use.

To get started, make sure that you have iTunes for Windows installed or update your existing version to at least iTunes 12.5.1. Once done, follow the instructions below.

- **Step 2. Pick Source and Destination Positions**

Your old iPhone from which you are transferring data will be the "Source" device. Similarly, your new iPhone to which you want to move data will be in the "Destination" position. In case positions are wrong, use the "Flip" button to interchange the positions.

- **Step 3. Start and Complete the Data Transfer Process**

The last part includes selecting the data you want to transfer. You can select the data within the transfer screen and, upon making your choices, proceed by clicking "Start Transfer." It's important to note that during this process, you'll need to deactivate the "Find My" feature on iOS devices. When done, the data process will commence automatically.

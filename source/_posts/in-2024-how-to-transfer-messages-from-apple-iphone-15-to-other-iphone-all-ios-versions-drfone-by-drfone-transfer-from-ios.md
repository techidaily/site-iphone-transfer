It might sound surprising, but it can be a little complicated to learn how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone. In this tutorial, we will answer the question – how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to SIM and provide a foolproof way to save and restore your iPhone contacts. Let’s get it started and learn more about how to export contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to SIM.

## Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?

Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn’t provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.

Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can’t export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly. This is because Apple assumes the transfer of contacts via SIM card is an obsolete method. Don’t worry – you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.

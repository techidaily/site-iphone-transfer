Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 11 to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn‚Äôt provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.

Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can‚Äôt export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly. This is because Apple assumes the transfer of contacts via SIM card is an obsolete method. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.

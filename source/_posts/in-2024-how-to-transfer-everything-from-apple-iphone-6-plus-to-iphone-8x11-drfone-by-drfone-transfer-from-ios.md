- Open iTunes and insert the CD that you wish to import into the disc drive
- The options might appear in an instant. If you want to import every song on the disc, select **yes** and click **No**, in case you want specific music to import.
- In case, you clicked on ‘NO’, Select the menu on the top-left side of the iTunes window and select the audio CD in the list.

- Then, check the files you want to import to iTunes, then select **Import CD**.
- The preferences option appears and you need to select the preferences and click OK after the preference has been done.

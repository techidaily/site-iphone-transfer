## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

## Part 4. Move Contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Including iPhone 15 using iTunes

iTunes is a great solution to transfer iPhone contacts. Many users prefer iTunes while transferring contacts because it comes directly from Apple, and it takes care of all your iOS device management needs. These steps will help you to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone using iTunes-

**Install iTunes and connect source iPhone**

Download the latest version of iTunes on your PC, install it properly, and launch the software. Connect your source iPhone to your PC, and iTunes will automatically detect it.

**Backup Contacts**

Now click on the “Device” option and then select iPhone. Then you need to select the “Summary” option and then choose “This Computer” and “Back Up Now” to back up all your data and contacts on your PC.

**Restore Backup**

In the end, you need to connect your target iPhone to your PC and choose the “Summary” option in the iTunes software. You need to choose the “Restore Backup” option and then browse and select the latest backup folder. At last, choose the “Restore” option. iTunes transfers contacts and all the data from the source iPhone to target the iPhone, and it’s essential to back up the data from your source iPhone.

If you want to transfer contacts from your old iPhone to a new one, you need to use Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer because it’s the best solution to use a 1-Click system to copy contacts from one phone to another in a very easy and fast way. You can also use iCloud backup, iCloud syncing, and iTunes to transfer your contacts, but Dr.Fone can give you the safest and easiest solution.

## Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone Including iPhone 15 by restoring from iCloud backup

You can easily transfer your contacts using iCloud backup without factory resetting the entire device and starting again. Just follow this process-

**Log in to iCloud**

You need to connect both your iPhones to Wi-Fi and log into your iCloud account from both of your iPhones.

**Sync Contacts and Backup**

Now you need to take your source iPhone and go to the Settings option. Then you need to tap the name at the top, go to the iCloud option, scroll down and make sure the option for Contact is toggled on. If you have iOS 10.2 and earlier on your phone, you will find it in Settings > iCloud.

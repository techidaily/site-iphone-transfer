## Part 2: Transfer photos from Android to iPhone including iPhone 15/15 Pro(Max) using Move to iOS App?

Now, to answer how to transfer photos from Android to iPhone, there is another simple solution that you can make use of. It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.

Note: This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App.

Now to proceed, first of all, you need to do some settings on your iPhone device as follows:

On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps & Data’ > choose ‘Move Data from Android’ option.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

The next step is to take your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- Switch to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, open Google Play Store, and search for ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
- At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android device.

- On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-enrer the code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-9.jpg)

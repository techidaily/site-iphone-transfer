## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone

Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 7 device for these methods to work.

### 3\. Internet Dependency

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### 5\. Compatibility Issues

Older iPhone models might not support the latest iOS versions or certain features. It leads to compatibility issues when transferring data between devices. This is a prominent issue when dealing with different iOS versions.

## Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone 7 Data Directly to iPhone 15?

While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone 7  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the "Quick Start" method, and you can use it by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone 7  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone 7  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.
- **Step 2:** A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone 7 , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping "Continue." Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.

It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is **how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone** via iCloud sync:

- **Step 1.** Ensure you're signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press "iCloud" to proceed.

![access icloud in settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg)

## Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Using iCloud Backup

Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can't restore messages selectively with this method. Here is **how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone** using iCloud backup:

- **Step 1.** Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open "Settings," tap on your name, and select "iCloud." Tap "iCloud Backup" and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.

![back up now button icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Next, opt for "Restore from iCloud Backup." Then, log in to your iCloud account with the identical credentials employed during the backup process. Pick the latest backup from the available options, including the messages you aim to transfer.

## Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone via iTunes/Finder

Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone's data, including messages.

Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to **transfer messages from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone** via iTunes/Finder backup:

- **Step 1.** Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone 6 device to access the "Summary" tab, while in Finder, access the "General" tab. Here, go to "Backups" and choose "Back Up Now" to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either "This Computer" (for iTunes) or "Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac" (for Finder).

![create backup in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-8.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Once the backup is completed, start setting up your new iPhone. Once you reach the "Apps & Data" screen, select "Restore from Mac or PC,” and follow this guide:

**For Finder/iTunes:** Link your iPhone to the PC and gain access by clicking on the “Device” icon at the top left corner.

While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone 13 mini  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the "Quick Start" method, and you can use it by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone 13 mini  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone 13 mini  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.
- **Step 2:** A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone 13 mini , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping "Continue." Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.

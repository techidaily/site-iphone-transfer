### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts.

If you have all of your calendar events, contacts, documents, and photos synced with iCloud and all is on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to re-sync all on your Google Pixel device. Android’s cloud version is housed in Google apps such as Gmail, Contacts, Docs, Drive, etc. When you set up your Google Pixel, you’ll create and set up a Google account. From this point, you can sync some of the iCloud content with the Google account, thus you won’t need to re-enter lots of info.

**Step 3:** Finally, hit the “Start Transfer” button to begin the transfer and that’s it.

And if you ever want to get back to your iPhone, then you would probably wonder how to switch from Pixel to iPhone. In that case, all you need is a phone-to-phone data transfer app like Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer to make the switch successful with all the data you need on your new device.



## The Bottom Line

Switching between the iPhone and Google Pixel demands thoughtful deliberation, as evidenced by the ongoing debate. Factors like OS preferences, app compatibility, and data synchronization need to be considered. While the transition process may seem daunting, many tools can simplify the switch. They ensure a smooth experience of switching from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to Google Pixel.

In this context, Wondershare Dr.Fone emerges as a comprehensive and user-friendly solution. It helps you in transferring data from an iPhone to a Google Pixel. With its versatile data transfer capabilities and emphasis on data security, Dr.Fone offers a reliable and efficient data transfer method.

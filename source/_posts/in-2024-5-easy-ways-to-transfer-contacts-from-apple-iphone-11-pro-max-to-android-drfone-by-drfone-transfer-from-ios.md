## Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android using iTunes

If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account.

Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android using iTunes.

**1.** Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.

**2.** Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the "**Sync Contacts**" option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.

**3.** Ensure that you choose to sync "All Contacts" before clicking on the "**Apply" button**.

**4.** Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. Go to your Account > Contacts and click on the "Export" button on the toolbar.

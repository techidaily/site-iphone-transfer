Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:

- **Step 1:** To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.

### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone SE to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes/Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device's data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone SE to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes/Finder:

- **Step 1:** After ensuring the latest iTunes/Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the "Summary" tab in iTunes, click the "Device" icon. On Finder, select iPhone from "Locations" and access the "General" tab.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Move to the "Backups" section on iTunes/Finder and click "Back Up Now." Before this, confirm the selection of "This Computer" in iTunes and for Finder" or "Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac."

![back up latest data on computer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg)

- **Step 3:** Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary/General” tab and click "Restore Backup." Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 4. Email

Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:

- **Step 1:** Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap "Share Contact." From the available sharing options, select "Email" and enter your email address in the recipient field.

![access ios device in itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

- **Step 2:** Tap "Send" to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won't be added directly. To save the contact, tap "Create New Contact," write any contact details, and select "Done" to finish saving the contact.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone SE to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

### How to Transfer Data from Apple iPhone SE to Android

**1\. Transfer Contacts in accounts:** To transfer contacts in Facebook, Twitter, Google and any accounts on your iPhone to Android phone or tablet, you should sign in the accounts on your iPhone.

**2\. Backup and restore:** Your Android phone or tablet is not right now in your hand? Don't worry. Just use it to backup iPhone data to computer, and then restore to your Apple iPhone SE or tablet whenever you need.

#### Step 1. Run iPhone to Android Data Transfer Tool

Launch Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer on your Windows PC or Mac. On its homepage, choose the "Phone Transfer" option and click on it.

![iphone to android contacts transfer](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

#### Step 2. Connect Your iPhone and Android Device to Computer with USB Cables

Connect your iPhone and Android device to the computer. Two devices will be soon detected and shown in the window below.

#### Step 3. Start Data Transfer from Apple iPhone SE to Android

Scan the supported files to ensure what you're going to transfer. Click "Start Transfer". If you have many useless files on your Apple iPhone SE, you can check "Clear data before copy".

![transfer contacts from iphone to android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-5.png)

Don't have a computer at hand? Just try the [Android app of Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.mobiletrans&hl=en), which allows you to directly **transfer data from Apple iPhone SE to Android**, and bring iCloud data to Android without any hassle.



## Method 2. Transfer Data One by One from Apple iPhone SE to Android for Free

Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone SE to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone SE to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it's impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone SE or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone SE to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone SE or tablet.

### Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone SE to Android via iCloud

When switching from Apple iPhone SE to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts.

That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

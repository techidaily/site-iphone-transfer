4\. To transfer these music files, connect your Android to the system and choose to use it as a media transfer device.

5\. Browse to the iTunes music folder, copy the selected songs, and transfer them to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. If you have a Mac, then you need to use Android File Transfer to do the same.

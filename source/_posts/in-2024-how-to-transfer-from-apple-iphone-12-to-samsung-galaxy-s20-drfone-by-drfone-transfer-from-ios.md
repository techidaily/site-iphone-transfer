You can easily learn how to transfer contacts from one iPhone to another (like iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro) using iCloud syncing. It takes very little time, and all it needs is one apple account signed in to both your source and target iPhones at a time. Just follow these steps properly-

**Merge Contacts**

You need to go to the “Settings” option of your source iPhone and tap on your name at the top of the settings screen. Check the “Contacts” option is toggled on or not from the “iCloud” option. After that, hit merge to upload your contacts on iCloud.

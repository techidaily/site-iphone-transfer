### Method 3. iTunes/Finder

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

- **Step 1:** Navigate to Phone Transfer in Dr.Fone. Within Wondershare Dr.Fone, access the "Toolbox" tab and click "Phone Transfer." Now, you will need to connect both iOS devices to the computer. Wait for Dr.Fone to recognize and load them. Once they are loaded, assign the "Source" and "Destination" positions to the Apple iPhone 8 devices.

When you have selected the desired data, click "Start Transfer" to proceed. A prompt will soon be displayed on the screen, requesting the deactivation of the Find My feature on iOS devices. Access the iOS device's Settings and tap on the name located at the top.

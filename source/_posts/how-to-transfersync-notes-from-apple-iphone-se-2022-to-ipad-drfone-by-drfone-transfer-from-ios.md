## Method 2: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone without iCloud (Selective Transfer) \[iPhone 15 Included\]

When you want to transfer your photos separately without transferring the other iDevice data, there is a perfect tool for you:Â [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-transfer.html). This action takes no time at all, and you can transfer the images within a matter of a few seconds. You can also use this phone manager app to transfer data from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to Android and iTunes or vice versa.

In addition, Wondershare Dr.Fone works efficiently without losing data while transferring media files between iOS devices. It can also transfer videos, contacts, messages, etc., from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone. Here is how to selectively transfer photos from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone without transferring the complete iPhone data via Wondershare Dr.Fone:

**Step 1: Proceed With the Phone Manager feature**

First, you need to install Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and connect both your iDevices to the computer using the Apple-certified USB cables. Next, locate the iPhone from which you want to transfer the images and expand it. Choose the âPhotosâ tab and let Wondershare Dr.Fone load all the pictures.

**Step 2: Perform the Selective Photos Transfer**

Once Dr.Fone detects all the photos in your iPhone, it will categorize them in the albums like they are in your iDevice. Choose the pictures you want to transfer and tap the âTo Deviceâ option. Then, click on the iPhone on which you want to send all the selected images and complete the photo transfer process.

## Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes \[iPhone 15 Included\]

Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data. In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:

**Step 1:** To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the "Phone" icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the "Summary" tab. Then, navigate to the "Backups" section and check the "This Computer" option. Then, hit the "Back Up Now" button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.

![tap back up now button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the "Backups" section in the "Summary" tab. Here, tap "Restore Backup" and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap "Restore" and wait for the backup to be restored.

## Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop \[iPhone 15 Included\]

AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner. Unlike iCloud or iTunes, it does not need to sync all the photos. You just have to select the photos from one of your iPhones and AirDrop them to another. However, the other iPhone should be within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range of the host iDevice. Here are the instructions you need to follow to AirDrop photos from old iPhone to new iPhone efficiently:

**Step 1:** On your old iPhone, you need to open the "Photos" app and hop into the desired folder. Next, pick the photos you want to share by tapping the "Select" button in the upper right corner.

**Step 2:** Following this, you will have to tap the âShareâ icon, followed by selecting the targeted âAirDropâ recipient iPhone. Then, on the target iPhone, you have to choose âAcceptâ to receive them.

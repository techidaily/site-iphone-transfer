## Method 2. Transfer Data One by One from Apple iPhone 13 to Android for Free

Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone 13 to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 13 to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it's impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 13 or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 13 to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 13 or tablet.

### Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android via iCloud

When switching from Apple iPhone 13 to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it's not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in [transferring contacts from Android to Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html).

Don't worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it's easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.

Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to _Settings_ and select _iCloud_.

Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on _Contacts_ to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

- **Step 2. Pick Source and Destination Positions**

Your old iPhone from which you are transferring data will be the "Source" device. Similarly, your new iPhone to which you want to move data will be in the "Destination" position. In case positions are wrong, use the "Flip" button to interchange the positions.

- **Step 3. Start and Complete the Data Transfer Process**

The last part includes selecting the data you want to transfer. You can select the data within the transfer screen and, upon making your choices, proceed by clicking "Start Transfer." It's important to note that during this process, you'll need to deactivate the "Find My" feature on iOS devices. When done, the data process will commence automatically.

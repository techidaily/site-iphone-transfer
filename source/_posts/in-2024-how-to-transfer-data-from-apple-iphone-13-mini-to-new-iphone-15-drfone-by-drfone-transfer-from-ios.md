- The preferences option appears and you need to select the preferences and click OK after the preference has been done.

- Then you have to wait till the music is ripped to the iTunes library.
- As soon as the import is complete, attach your device to the computer.
- You can now drag the album to the right side of the iTunes window where a pane will appear containing the music on your device. Drop it right on your iPod or other devices.

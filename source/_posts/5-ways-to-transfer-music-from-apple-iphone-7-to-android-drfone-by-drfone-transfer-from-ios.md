Step 3. Now, on the iPhone 8/11/11 Pro, start setting it up once again and connect it to a WiFi network.

Step 4. Once you reach the “Set Up” Page, select “**Restore from iCloud backup**” .

Step 5. Select the most recent back up file. Feed in your Apple ID details and let the iPhone restore all the data from iCloud backup. Let your iPhone 8/11/11 Pro reboot at the end of restoration process.

**Moving data from old Apple iPhone 7 to new iPhone 8/11/11 Pro** is an easy job with the help of three tools listed above. All our data, such as photos, videos, music, contacts, notes, calendar, messages, Apps, etc, are important to us and need to be restored in the new device for us to start enjoying our new iPhone 8/11/11 Pro.

We recommend that you download and install this software right away and also share your experience along with this guide with your friends and family.

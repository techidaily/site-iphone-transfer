This article covers step-by-step instructions so you can easily and efficiently manage and transfer your iPhone photos to your computer while preserving your cherished memories.

## **Part 1: How To Transfer Pictures From Apple iPhone 7 to PC with iCloud**

One of the widely used and efficient methods to transfer pictures from your iPhone to a PC is through iCloud, Apple's cloud-based service. iCloud provides seamless integration across Apple devices, allowing users to sync and access their photos and videos effortlessly.

However, even if your PC is using other operating systems, such as Windows, you can still use iCloud for Windows to save and transfer your iPhone photos from iCloud.

How to **transfer iPhone photos to a computer** using iCloud:

**Step 1:** Make sure you have synced iCloud photos on your iPhone.

On your iPhone Settings, go to your profile and tap iCloud. Then, select Photos and turn on the switch next to “Sync this \[device\].” Otherwise, go to iCloud settings > iCloud Drive, and switch on “Sync this iPhone.”

That’s it! Now, you can find your iPhone Photos on your computer.

## **Part 2: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with Google Drive**

Another convenient way **to transfer iPhone pics to a computer** is through Google Drive. As a cloud-based storage solution, Google Drive allows users to seamlessly store, manage, and share files, including photos, across different devices.

Open Google Drive on your iPhone. Once opened, tap the multicolored + symbol and select "Upload" > "Photos and Videos." If prompted, grant access to all photos by tapping "Allow Access to All Photos."

## **Part 3: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with iTunes**

You can also make the most of iTunes to secure your iPhone with backups, keep it up-to-date, or synchronize content between your iOS device and your computer in both directions. Even if you're a Windows PC user, there's no need to fret. Although iTunes is an Apple product, it’s also available for Windows use.

To get started, make sure that you have iTunes for Windows installed or update your existing version to at least iTunes 12.5.1. Once done, follow the instructions below.

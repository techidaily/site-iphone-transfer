**Sync Contacts and Backup**

Now you need to take your source iPhone and go to the Settings option. Then you need to tap the name at the top, go to the iCloud option, scroll down and make sure the option for Contact is toggled on. If you have iOS 10.2 and earlier on your phone, you will find it in Settings > iCloud.

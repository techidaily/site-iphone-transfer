3. **What if I face issues during the transfer process?**

In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:

- Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.

- Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.
- For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.

4. **Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?**

Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.

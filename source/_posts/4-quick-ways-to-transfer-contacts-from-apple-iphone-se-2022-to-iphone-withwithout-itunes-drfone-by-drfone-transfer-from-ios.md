To start with, let’s learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone using iTunes. If you have an updated version of iTunes, you can transfer and sync your data between various devices. Ideally, you can either sync your contacts or backup and restore them. We have discussed both of these techniques to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone with iTunes.

### Method 1: Backup and Restore iPhone contacts with iTunes

This is the easiest approach to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone with iTunes.

- **1.** Firstly, connect your existing iPhone to your system and launch iTunes.
- **2.** Select your device and visit its Summary section.
- **3.** Under the Backups section, choose to take a backup on the local computer.

- **6.** From here, click on the “Restore Backup” and select the target backup and device.

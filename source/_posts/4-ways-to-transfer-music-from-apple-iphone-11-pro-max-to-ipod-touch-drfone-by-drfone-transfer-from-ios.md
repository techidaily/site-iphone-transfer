## Part 2: Notice That You Should Know Before Switching from iPhone To Google Pixel

Before you switch iPhone to Pixel 2, there are certain things to consider or you need to do, so let’s have a look at them-

### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.

Some apps you had on your iDevice may not even be accessible for your Google Pixel device and vice-versa. However, if you’ve subscribed to a service such as Spotify, you just have to get the app and sign in to your new Android device and that’s it.

### 3- Re-Sync Your Crucial Data

If you have all of your calendar events, contacts, documents, and photos synced with iCloud and all is on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to re-sync all on your Google Pixel device. Android’s cloud version is housed in Google apps such as Gmail, Contacts, Docs, Drive, etc. When you set up your Google Pixel, you’ll create and set up a Google account. From this point, you can sync some of the iCloud content with the Google account, thus you won’t need to re-enter lots of info.

With eSIMs, the process of switching between devices is typically smoother compared to physical SIM cards. The reason is it involves digital activation and can be done remotely without the need to swap cards physically.

2. **Is there a difference between switching physical SIM cards and using eSIM for transferring phone services between Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and other iPhones?**

Physical SIM cards are tangible, removable chips that need to be inserted into a SIM card tray, whereas eSIMs are integrated directly into the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device's hardware. Swapping physical SIM cards involves physically removing and inserting the card into the new device, whereas transferring an eSIM between devices can be done remotely. Physical SIM cards can store limited contact information and some network settings, whereas eSIMs can store multiple network profiles.

## Conclusion

This article has provided a valuable overview of **switching SIM cards to new Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and other iPhones**. With a proper understanding of the repercussions involved in the process, a guide has been discussed. Along with its thorough discussion, you have also figured out how to transfer data to a new iPhone. For that, Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer is the best option in the market.

### 1- Disable iMessage

When messaging other iPhones from your iDevice, they’ll communicate through iMessage when you connect to the internet. That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.

Yes, you can use the same eSIM card to switch between different Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and other iPhones, provided that the specific carrier supports eSIM technology and allows the transfer of the eSIM between devices.

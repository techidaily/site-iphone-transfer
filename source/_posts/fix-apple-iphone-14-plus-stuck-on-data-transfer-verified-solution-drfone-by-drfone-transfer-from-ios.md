## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 14 Plus Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

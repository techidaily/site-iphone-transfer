## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

If you are transferring the data to your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max using iCloud, you need a good Wi-Fi connection to ensure a smooth process. A slow Wi-Fi connection can stop or delay the data transfer process if your iCloud backup is in 100+ GBs.

### **4\. Problem in the iOS Version**

When performing iPhone-to-iPhone data transfer, ensure that both iPhones are free from any iOS bugs. For this purpose, update your older iPhone to the latest iOS version to avoid bugs and glitches. If you are using the iOS 17 Beta version on your old iPhone, it can also cause this issue.

## Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android with Google Account

Another fast and hassle-free way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android is by using your Google Account. Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.

**Step 1.** Unlock your iPhone and go to its **Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account** and tap on "Google."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 4.** Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.

## Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android with iCloud

Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

**1.** Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are **synced with iCloud**. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.

**2.** Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and **log in** with your Apple ID.

**3.** After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the "Contacts" option from the home screen.

**4.** This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.

**5.** Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose "**Export vCard**." This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.

**6.** Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.

**7.** From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.

**8.** Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.

## Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using iTunes

If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using iTunes.

**1.** Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.

**2.** Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the "**Sync Contacts**" option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.

**3.** Ensure that you choose to sync "All Contacts" before clicking on the "**Apply" button**.

**4.** Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 14 device. Go to your Account > Contacts and click on the "Export" button on the toolbar.

**5.** Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.

If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup.

**2.** The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.

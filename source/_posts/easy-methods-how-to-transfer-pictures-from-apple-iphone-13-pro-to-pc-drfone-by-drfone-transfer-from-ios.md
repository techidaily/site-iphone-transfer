## Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes \[iPhone 15 Included\]

Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data.

**Step 1:** To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the "Phone" icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the "Summary" tab. Then, navigate to the "Backups" section and check the "This Computer" option. Then, hit the "Back Up Now" button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.

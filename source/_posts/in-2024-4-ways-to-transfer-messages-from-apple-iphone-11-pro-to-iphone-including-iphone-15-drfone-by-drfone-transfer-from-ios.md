## How to Transfer Data from iOS Devices to Motorola Phones

**Issues about transferring data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Motorola G5/G5Plus**

There are several items like contacts and calendar that you could transfer from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Motorola phone. Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone.

If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

After installing this Android app, you can download iCloud data to your ZTE directly, or connect iPhone to ZTE for data transfer using an iPhone-to-Android adapter._

This problem is however negated by the fact that it will take a very short time to transfer everything, so there is no need to back-up anything.

### Steps to transfer data from Apple iPhone SE to ZTE by Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer

Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?

The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.

Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.

Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes/Finder backups are used to restore the entire device's data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.

## Part 2: Transfer photos from Android to iPhone including iPhone 15/15 Pro(Max) using Move to iOS App?

Now, to answer how to transfer photos from Android to iPhone, there is another simple solution that you can make use of. It is called the “Move to iOS app,” which you can download freely from the Google Play store.

Note: This solution only works when you set up the iPhone. If the iPhone is already set up, you need to factory reset it and set it up to restore photos with this App.

Now to proceed, first of all, you need to do some settings on your iPhone device as follows:

On your iPhone, go to a screen called ‘Apps & Data’ > choose ‘Move Data from Android’ option.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-app and data](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-6.jpg) ![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move data from android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-7.jpg)

The next step is to take your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to complete the transfer process with the “Move to iOS” app.

- Switch to your Apple iPhone SE (2020), open Google Play Store, and search for ‘Move to iOS’ app.
- Open the ‘Move to iOS’ app to accept permission requests, install it, and open the app.
- At this point, tap Continue on both your iOS and Android device.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-move from android to ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-8.jpg)

- On your Apple iPhone SE (2020), enter the 12-digit code of the iPhone. This is so that the ‘Move to iOS’ app knows which iOS device it has to transfer the data to.

![how to transfer photos from android to iphone-enrer the code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-photos-from-android-to-iphone-9.jpg)

Before the transfer starts, you will be asked a number of questions, like do you want to transfer Google Account information, Bookmarks, etc. Now, since you only want videos and photos, deselect the other options except ‘Camera Roll’

The above process to transfer pictures from Android to iPhone is good for mobile users who are unwilling to invest money in software. However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.

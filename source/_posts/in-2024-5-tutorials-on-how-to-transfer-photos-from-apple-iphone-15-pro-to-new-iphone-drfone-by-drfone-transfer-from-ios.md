## Everything You Need to Know About Shared Album

The Photos mobile application on iOS devices is a very powerful gallery software. It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes.

For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.

## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 15 Pro to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

A major drawback of using methods like Quick Start, iTunes, and iCloud is that they restore the entire device's data. Users cannot selectively transfer data using any of these three methods.

### 2\. iPhone Setup Requirement

The transfer methods like iCloud and Quick Start can only be employed when setting up a new iOS device. For old devices, you must factory reset the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device for these methods to work.

Restoring iCloud Backup on your new iPhone requires a stable and relatively fast internet connection. This can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity or limited data plans. If the internet is unstable, it could lead to issues during the iCloud backup restoration.

### 4\. Limited Storage on iCloud

iCloud offers 5 GB of free storage, which might not be sufficient for users with large amounts of data. Users might need to buy more iCloud storage to accommodate their backups, incurring extra costs.

### 5\. Compatibility Issues

Older iPhone models might not support the latest iOS versions or certain features. It leads to compatibility issues when transferring data between devices. This is a prominent issue when dealing with different iOS versions.

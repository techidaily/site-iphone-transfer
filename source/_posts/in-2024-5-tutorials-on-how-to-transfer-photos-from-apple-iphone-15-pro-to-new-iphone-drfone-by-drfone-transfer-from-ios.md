When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry.

On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder.

## Part 3: Other solutions to transfer iPhone contacts

While you can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to SIM directly, you can always move your contacts from one phone to another. We have listed some easy solutions to help you resolve your query on how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone with some alternative methods.

### Save your contacts to iCloud

By default, every user gets a free space of 5 GB on iCloud (which can later be expanded). Therefore, you can easily take a backup of your contacts and other important files on iCloud. Just go to your device’s Settings > iCloud and turn the backup option on. Make sure that the backup for Contacts is turned on as well. This will sync your contacts to iCloud, letting you access them on the go. In this way, you don’t have to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to SIM.

### Export iPhone contacts Via iTunes

Another alternative to learning how to export contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to SIM is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Simply connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to the system and launch iTunes. Select your iPhone and go to its “Info” tab. From here, you can sync its contacts with iTunes. This will keep your contacts safe and allow you to sync them with another iOS device.

### Copy iPhone Contacts Using Gmail

Just like iCloud, you can also sync your contacts with Gmail. If you don’t use Gmail, then go to your iPhone’s Accounts Settings and set up your Gmail account. Later, you can go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar > Gmail and toggle on the syncing option for Contacts.

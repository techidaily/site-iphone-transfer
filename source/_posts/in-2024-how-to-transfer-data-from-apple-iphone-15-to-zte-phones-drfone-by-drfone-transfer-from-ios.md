## Part 1: Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone Including iPhone 12/ 12 Pro (Max)/ 12 Mini with iTunes

To start with, let’s learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone using iTunes. If you have an updated version of iTunes, you can transfer and sync your data between various devices. Ideally, you can either sync your contacts or backup and restore them. We have discussed both of these techniques to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone with iTunes.

### Method 1: Backup and Restore iPhone contacts with iTunes

This is the easiest approach to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone with iTunes. In this, we will first take a backup of our old phone (including contacts) and later restore the backup to a new device. Needless to say, all the existing data on the target device would be erased, and with your contacts, the entire backup will be restored.

- **1.** Firstly, connect your existing iPhone to your system and launch iTunes.
- **2.** Select your device and visit its Summary section.
- **3.** Under the Backups section, choose to take a backup on the local computer.
- **4.** In the end, click on the “Backup Now” button and wait for iTunes to backup your device entirely.

- **5.** Once you have taken a backup locally, you can connect the target device and go to its Summary.
- **6.** From here, click on the “Restore Backup” and select the target backup and device.

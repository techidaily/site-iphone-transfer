## How to Transfer Data from iOS Devices to Motorola Phones

**Issues about transferring data from Apple iPhone XR to Motorola G5/G5Plus**

There are several items like contacts and calendar that you could transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Motorola phone. Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.

One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.

For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.

## Bonus Tips: Having Trouble When Transferring to iPhone 15 Stucks?

The issue of iPhone 15 getting stuck when users attempt to transfer data from their older devices, like the iPhone 14, to the new iPhone 15 has become a frustrating challenge for many Apple enthusiasts. This problem often arises due to the complex nature of data migration and the high expectations associated with Apple's seamless ecosystem. When attempting to transfer photos, apps, contacts, and other vital information, users may encounter lengthy delays, frozen screens, or failed transfers.

The possible reasons could be:

- **·Software glitches**
- **·Insufficient storage space**
- **·Incompatible iOS versions between the old and new devices**

The impact of this issue extends beyond mere inconvenience, as it can result in data loss or a less-than-optimal out-of-the-box experience with the latest iPhone. Addressing this problem, you may try:

- **·Updating both devices to the latest iOS version**
- **·Ensuring sufficient storage**
- **·Seeking assistance from Apple Support**
- **·Authorized service providers when necessary**

Or, you can also try to ask for help from a third-party application, [Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) is always at your service.

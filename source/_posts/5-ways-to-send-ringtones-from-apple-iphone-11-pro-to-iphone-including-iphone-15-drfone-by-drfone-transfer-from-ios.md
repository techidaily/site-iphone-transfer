- **Step 1. Access Phone Transfer and Connect iOS Devices**

Launch [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) after installing it and access the "Toolbox" tab. Here, click "Phone Transfer" and connect both of your iOS devices to the computer. Once they are detected by Dr.Fone, move to assign them to the correct positions.

- **Step 2. Pick Source and Destination Positions**

Your old iPhone from which you are transferring data will be the "Source" device. Similarly, your new iPhone to which you want to move data will be in the "Destination" position. In case positions are wrong, use the "Flip" button to interchange the positions.

- **Step 3. Start and Complete the Data Transfer Process**

The last part includes selecting the data you want to transfer. You can select the data within the transfer screen and, upon making your choices, proceed by clicking "Start Transfer." It's important to note that during this process, you'll need to deactivate the "Find My" feature on iOS devices. When done, the data process will commence automatically.

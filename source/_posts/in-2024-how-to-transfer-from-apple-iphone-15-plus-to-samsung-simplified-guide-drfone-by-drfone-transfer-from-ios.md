## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

## Part 3: How to Transfer Everything from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 with iCloud

iCould is another software which also enables the transfer of data from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11. In order to transfer data Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 using iCloud, you can consider the following steps to make the process easy.

1. Just like iTunes, with iCloud too you need to back up your data to iCloud so that it can be restored to your new iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11. In order to back up, first you need to connect the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to the Wi-Fi network. Then go to the setting, click on iCloud button and then click on to iCloud backup. You need to check whether the iCloud backup is turned on or not. Make sure it is turned on. Click on "**back up now**". Keep your phone connected to Wi-Fi until the process is completed.

1. Connect your iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11 to the computer when "Hello" screen appears.
2. Connect your phone to the Wi-Fi network.
3. To restore from iCloud backup, sign in to iCloud with the help of apple id and password.

1. The application will ask for the backup. Once you've checked that the backup is correct you can click on it.
2. Make sure your device is connected to it until the process is completed.

iTunes, iCloud and Dr.Fone are few of the methods which tend to enable the **transfer data from old iPhone to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11**. However, considering the complexity of the iTunes and iCloud, we'd urge the readers if they can try the Dr.Fone at least once. It is not only easy but also less time consuming. It prevents the additional steps such as backup and restore settings. Rather, the entire process is done with just one click. Dr.Fone is highly user friendly and a bit different from traditional ways of transfer data Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone 8 (Plus)/X/11.

We know the emotions and sentiments attached with one’s personal information and thus we have tried to give users a platform, where they can make the transition from one phone to another extremely simple. Simply download and have a try.

Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android. They're totally free but just take some time.

### Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android

As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it's impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or tablet.

### Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android via iCloud

When switching from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card.

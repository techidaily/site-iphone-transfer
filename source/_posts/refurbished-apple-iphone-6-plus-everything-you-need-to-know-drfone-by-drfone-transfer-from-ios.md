But before starting, let’s shed some light on what refurbished iPhones actually are because some people aren’t aware of this term.

## **Part 1. What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone 6 Plus mean?**

Before going further, let's clarify what exactly a refurbished Apple iPhone 6 Plus is. In simple words, you can say that it is a device that has gone through a series of checks and repairs. So that it can work the same way as a brand-new Apple iPhone 6 Plus does. If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.

When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn't go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device's functions to stop. Moreover, it's also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.

Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.

## **Part 2. What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?**

No doubt, refurbished iPhones are the same as the new ones. So, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the brand-new Apple iPhone 6 Plus at a lower price. If you are fine with a few scratches, refurbished iPhones have a lot more to offer you. The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone 6 Plus are as follows:

![An illustration of eco-friendly technology.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png)

- **Warranty and Support**

If you get a refurbished Apple iPhone 6 Plus from Apple, you get a one-year warranty. You also get 90 days of free technical support. So, this warranty provides you peace of mind, just like you get when you buy a new iPhone.

- **Miscellaneous Benefits**

Well, we have explored the benefits, but is it safe to buy a refurbished iPhone? Let's find out!

## **Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?**

Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.

On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 6 Plus from a private seller, make sure that it's not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.

It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.

## **Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.**

Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:

1. **Seller Reputation**

Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple's official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.

**Compatibility**

Ensure the used Apple iPhone 6 Plus you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.

**Storage**

Choose the Apple iPhone 6 Plus model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.

**Warranty Coverage**

Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty's duration and what it covers.

**Condition and History**

Ask questions about the phone's condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.

**Return Policy**

Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.

**Original Accessories**

Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 6 Plus comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.

**Price Comparison**

Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you're getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.

By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Moving data from one iPhone to another can be easier using Apple's tools. These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for **how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone**:

### Method 1. Quick Start

The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 12 devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone** using Quick Start:

- **Step 1.** Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the "Set Up New iPhone" prompt appears, tap "Unlock to Continue." This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap "Continue" if you're comfortable with that.

## Part 2. What Are the Drawbacks of Using Official Methods for Transferring Data From Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone

Apple's official methods to **transfer data from Apple iPhone 12 to iPhone** offer convenience and reliability. Nevertheless, they do possess specific limitations and disadvantages. Users should consider these limitations to make a well-informed choice. It will help you find the most fitting approach for their requirements. Here are some of the downsides and constraints associated with Apple's official methods:

### 1\. Entire Devices Backups

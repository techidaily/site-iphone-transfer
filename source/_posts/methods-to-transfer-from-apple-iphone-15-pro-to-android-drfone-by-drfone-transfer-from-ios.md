## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 15 Pro Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

## Easy Methods: How To Transfer Pictures From Apple iPhone SE to PC

Photo transfer from your iPhone to your PC is a common practice for various reasons. It can free up your device's storage space, create backups, or simply edit and organize your photos on a larger screen.

Thankfully, there are various methods to transfer pictures from your iPhone to your PC, providing flexibility to users based on their preferences and convenience. Read our comprehensive guide on **how to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone SE to PC**. This article covers step-by-step instructions so you can easily and efficiently manage and transfer your iPhone photos to your computer while preserving your cherished memories.

## **Part 1: How To Transfer Pictures From Apple iPhone SE to PC with iCloud**

One of the widely used and efficient methods to transfer pictures from your iPhone to a PC is through iCloud, Apple's cloud-based service. iCloud provides seamless integration across Apple devices, allowing users to sync and access their photos and videos effortlessly.

However, even if your PC is using other operating systems, such as Windows, you can still use iCloud for Windows to save and transfer your iPhone photos from iCloud.

How to **transfer iPhone photos to a computer** using iCloud:

**Step 1:** Make sure you have synced iCloud photos on your iPhone.

On your iPhone Settings, go to your profile and tap iCloud. Then, select Photos and turn on the switch next to “Sync this \[device\].” Otherwise, go to iCloud settings > iCloud Drive, and switch on “Sync this iPhone.”

**Step 3:** Keep iPhone photos on PC.

Open iCloud Photos and select the images you want to transfer to your PC. Right-click to open a drop-down menu and choose "Always keep on this device."

That’s it! Now, you can find your iPhone Photos on your computer.

## **Part 2: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with Google Drive**

Another convenient way **to transfer iPhone pics to a computer** is through Google Drive. As a cloud-based storage solution, Google Drive allows users to seamlessly store, manage, and share files, including photos, across different devices.

If you already have a Google account, you can jump right into Google Drive without signing up. However, be aware that the free version only gives you 15 GB of space. If you need more room, you'll have to sign up for a subscription.

**How to transfer iPhone pictures to a computer** with Google Drive:

**Step 1:** Set up your Google Drive.

Open Google Drive on your iPhone. Once opened, tap the multicolored + symbol and select "Upload" > "Photos and Videos." If prompted, grant access to all photos by tapping "Allow Access to All Photos."

**Step 2:** Upload your iPhone photos on Google Drive.

Browse through your iPhone albums to locate the specific photos you wish to upload. Hold and tap to select multiple photos. Then, tap "Upload" to upload your iPhone photos to Google Drive.

![Upload iPhone photos on Google Drive](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-pc-3.jpg)

Optional: Automatic backup or sync with Google Photos

For those seeking automatic backups, open Google Photos, tap your profile image, navigate to "Google Photos settings," and select "Backup & Sync." Toggle "Backup & Sync" to On for continuous backups.

**Step 3:** Transfer your iPhone photos from Google Drive to your PC.

Once your photos are stored on Google Drive, proceed to save and transfer them to your PC. Select the desired photos in Google Drive, and click "Download.”

![Download photos from Google Drive to PC.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-pc-4.jpg)

To save all photos from a specific Google Drive folder, open Google Drive and select "My Drive." Locate the intended folder, and click the three dots to open the drop-down menu. Select "Download," and all photos and files within the folder will be saved to your computer in ZIP format.

## **Part 3: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with iTunes**

You can also make the most of iTunes to secure your iPhone with backups, keep it up-to-date, or synchronize content between your iOS device and your computer in both directions. Even if you're a Windows PC user, there's no need to fret. Although iTunes is an Apple product, it’s also available for Windows use.

To get started, make sure that you have iTunes for Windows installed or update your existing version to at least iTunes 12.5.1. Once done, follow the instructions below.

**How to transfer iPhone pics to a PC** using iTunes:

**Step 1:** Connect your device to your computer.

Plug in your iPhone to your computer using a USB cable.

If your phone is asking you to Trust This Computer, tap "Trust" or "Allow to proceed."

**Step 3:** Open your computer's Photos app.

Go to the Start menu on your PC. Search and select Photos to open the Photos app.

![Open the Photos app on your computer.](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-pc-5.jpg)

Within the Photos app, click on Import > From a USB device and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose specific photos for the transfer and decide where to save them on your PC.

iCloud is another great way to transfer Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone 8/11/11 Pro in hassle free manner. Since it is a cloud service by Apple, it stores all our data and allows us to restore it on any and every iOS device with the same Apple ID and password.

Follow the steps given below to understand how to **transfer everything from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone 8/11/11 Pro**:

Step 1. Do not set up your new iPhone 8/11/11 Pro. If you already have, Visit **“Settings” > “General” > “Reset”** > Erase all content and settings to start from scratch.

Step 2. Now on your old Phone 5s, visit “**Settings**” and tap on your name. Select “**iCloud**” and scroll down to select “**iCloud Backup**” and hit “**Backup Now**”. Let the process finish completely and note down the exact timing of the back up file.

After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

## Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?

Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They've introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI's role in their 2024 phones. It's a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.

### 1\. Galaxy S24 Series

The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung's Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.

Moreover, Samsung's Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung's Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.

### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6

The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.

### 3\. Galaxy Z Fold 6

Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.

### 4\. Galaxy A55 5G

Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung's Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it's unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung's Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 series.

**Step 4.** Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.

## Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android with iCloud

Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.

**1.** Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are **synced with iCloud**. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.

**2.** Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and **log in** with your Apple ID.

**3.** After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the "Contacts" option from the home screen.

**4.** This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.

**5.** Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose "**Export vCard**." This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.

**6.** Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.

**7.** From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.

**8.** Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.

## Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android using iTunes

If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android using iTunes.

**1.** Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.

**2.** Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the "**Sync Contacts**" option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.

**3.** Ensure that you choose to sync "All Contacts" before clicking on the "**Apply" button**.

**4.** Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Go to your Account > Contacts and click on the "Export" button on the toolbar.

**5.** Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.

**6.** In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or import it to your Google Contacts as well.

## Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android without a computer

Often, users don't wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN).

**2.** The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.

**3.** You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.

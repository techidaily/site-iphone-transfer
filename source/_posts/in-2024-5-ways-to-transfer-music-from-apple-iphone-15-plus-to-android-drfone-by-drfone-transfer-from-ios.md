Use the following steps to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to PC** via iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 15 Plus , go to "Settings" and tap on your Apple ID. There, select "iCloud," tap "Photos," and toggle on "Sync This iPhone" on the next screen. This uploads your photos to iCloud.

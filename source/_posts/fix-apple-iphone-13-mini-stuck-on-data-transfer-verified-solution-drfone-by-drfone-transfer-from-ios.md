## Part 1: What Are the Problems Behind Apple iPhone 13 mini Stuck on Data Transfer

In this section, we will try to identify the root cause of the problem. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can better find a suitable solution to your problem.

### **1\. Bugs in the Move to iOS App**

It is possible that the Move to iOS app may cause problems while transferring data from your Apple iPhone 13 mini to your iPhone 15. This can happen because of two reasons: you haven't updated the app for a long time, or the updated version has some bugs in it.

### **2\. iTunes/Finder Backup is Corrupted**

Sometimes, the backup stored in the iTunes/Finder turns out to be corrupted due to various issues. If you are restoring data from such a corrupted backup, it can cause the Apple iPhone 13 mini to get stuck while transferring data. You have to identify corrupted backups in order to avoid this issue in your iPhone data process.

### **3\. Poor Wi-Fi Connection**

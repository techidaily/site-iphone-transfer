## Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone SE (2020) Data Directly to iPhone 15?

While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the "Quick Start" method, and you can use it by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.
- **Step 2:** A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping "Continue." Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.

![press the continue button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-3.jpg)

- **Step 3:** This animation contains security information and establishes a connection between devices. On the new iPhone, you will be required to provide the old phone passcode. Enter the passcode and log in using your Apple ID. Subsequently, select "Transfer from iPhone" and patiently await the process to finish.

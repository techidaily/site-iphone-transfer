## Part 2: How To Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 15 Plus to PC With Cloud Storages

Cloud storage offers a bridge between devices that goes beyond physical limitations. It lets you move photos from your Apple iPhone 15 Plus  to your desktop computer. This section will explore some of the popular cloud storage platforms since both of them offer their unique set of features and advantages. Described below are two cloud storage services to **import photos from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to PC**:

### Method 1: iCloud

iCloud is Apple's cloud storage service which seamlessly knits together the Apple ecosystem. It offers a harmonious blend of convenience and synchronization. The iCloud interface is intuitive and clean, making it accessible to all individuals. With iCloud, you can easily access your photos across devices in the Apple ecosystem. Use the following steps to **transfer photos from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to PC** via iCloud:

- **Step 1:** On your Apple iPhone 15 Plus , go to "Settings" and tap on your Apple ID. There, select "iCloud," tap "Photos," and toggle on "Sync This iPhone" on the next screen. This uploads your photos to iCloud.

![enable icloud photos sync feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-6.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Move to your computer and on your Windows PC, open a web browser, and go to the iCloud website. Log in with your Apple ID and password and click the "Photos" icon to access your iCloud Photo Library.

![download the desired photos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-8.jpg)

#### Pros

- Your photos are accessible not only on your PC but also on your other Apple devices.

#### Con

- The provided 5GB of free cloud storage falls significantly short of meeting the requirements for adequate data backup.

### Method 2: Google Drive

This enables easy photo transfer between various platforms. You get 15GB of free storage with Google Drive to store and transfer your data.

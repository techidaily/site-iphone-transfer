## Everything You Need to Know About Shared Album

The Photos mobile application on iOS devices is a very powerful gallery software. It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone XS to iPhone.”

For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.

Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS to Android using iTunes.

**1.** Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.

**2.** Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the "**Sync Contacts**" option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.

**3.** Ensure that you choose to sync "All Contacts" before clicking on the "**Apply" button**.

**4.** Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone XS device. Go to your Account > Contacts and click on the "Export" button on the toolbar.

**5.** Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.

**6.** In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone XS or import it to your Google Contacts as well.

## Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone XS to Android without a computer

Often, users don't wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone XS to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN). To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS to Android, follow these steps.

**1.** Firstly, download the **My Contacts app** on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.

**2.** The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.

**3.** You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.

**4.** Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.

**5.** Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone XS and Google Play Store.

**6.** Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard. In this way, all the saved contacts will be exported to your Apple iPhone XS.

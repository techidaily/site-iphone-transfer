On the other hand, Windows OS has long been the backbone of personal computing. They come equipped with a range of tools to make the photo transfer process smooth and efficient. Explained below are two of the common method to <strong>import photos from Apple iPhone 8 to PC</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-File-Explorer"><a href="#Method-1-File-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: File Explorer"></a>Method 1: File Explorer</h3><p>When it comes to simplicity and direct control, File Explorer stands out as an excellent option. It is a steadfast companion for transferring photos from your Apple iPhone 8  to your Windows PC. This method gives you the freedom to navigate through your device’s internal storage.</p><p>Moreover, you can select the images you desire and move them to your computer. Follow these straightforward steps to harness the power of File Explorer:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by connecting your Apple iPhone 8  to your Windows PC using an Apple-certified USB cable. Ensure that your iPhone is unlocked, and if prompted, tap “Trust This Computer” on your device’s screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on the trust option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On your Windows PC, press the “File Explorer” icon on your taskbar. In the left-hand panel of File Explorer, locate and click “This PC.” Your connected Apple iPhone 8  should appear under the “Devices and Drives” section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-photos-from-iphone-15-to-pc-2.jpg"                      alt="open the apple storage"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, double-click on your iPhone’s icon to access its internal storage. Most of your iPhone’s photos are stored in the “DCIM” folder.

Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature "                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-7-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-7-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry.

On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 3.

However, the method is not perfect because it is time-consuming. The transaction can neither be done quickly nor can it be done with a single click.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-transfer-photos-from-Android-to-iPhone-using-Google-Drive"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-transfer-photos-from-Android-to-iPhone-using-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to transfer photos from Android to iPhone using Google Drive?"></a>Part 3: How to transfer photos from Android to iPhone using Google Drive?</h2><p>Google Drive is cloud storage that is available to those who have a Gmail address.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

Stick with the article to find different ways for data <strong>transfer to the new iPhone 15</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Perform-iPhone-15-Data-Transfer-With-Official-Methods"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Perform-iPhone-15-Data-Transfer-With-Official-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Perform iPhone 15 Data Transfer With Official Methods"></a>Part 1: How To Perform iPhone 15 Data Transfer With Official Methods</h2><p>When it comes to data <strong>transfer to iPhone 15</strong> from your old phone, there are multiple options available. There are four official methods available to transfer data from an old phone to a new iPhone. These range from using backups like iCloud and iTunes to direct transfer. Given below are the 4 official methods to transfer your data to the new iPhone 15:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Method-1-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using iCloud Backup"></a>Method 1: Using iCloud Backup</h3><p>iCloud Backup emerges as a powerful solution when it comes to transferring your data to the iPhone 15. Apple’s cloud-based ecosystem enables you to migrate your essential information seamlessly. It ensures that your new device is an extension of your digital world. Follow these steps to use iCloud Backup for a smooth transition:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, we begin with creating a backup of your old iPhone. To do that, you need to navigate to Settings and tap Apple ID. Here choose “iCloud” and follow it by tapping “iCloud Backup.” Ensure it is toggled on, and use “Back Up Now” to create an iCloud backup.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-data-to-new-iphone-15-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on icloud backup"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now move to your new iPhone 15 and start setting it up. When you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen, tap “Restore from iCloud Backup.” Here, log in using your Apple ID and choose the most recent backup file to restore data.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-data-to-new-iphone-15-2.jpg"                      alt="choose the desired icloud backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-the-iTunes-Finder-Backup"><a href="#Method-2-Use-the-iTunes-Finder-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use the iTunes&#x2F;Finder Backup"></a>Method 2: Use the iTunes&#x2F;Finder Backup</h3><p>iTunes&#x2F;Finder presents a reliable and customizable option for data transfer to a new iPhone. It is great for those who prefer a more hands-on approach to data transfer. You can create a backup of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro on your computer. Later this backup is used to transfer your Apple iPhone 12 Pro data to the new one. Follow these steps to transfer your data using iTunes or Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by connecting your previous device to your computer using a USB cable. If you’re using macOS Catalina or a later version, open Finder; otherwise, open iTunes. When your device is detected, ensure it’s selected in iTunes or Finder.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to the “Summary” section and locate the “Back Up Now” option. Click on it to commence a comprehensive backup of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. The duration of this process depends on the volume of your data and may require some time.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-data-to-new-iphone-15-3.jpg"                      alt="press the back up now button"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Power up your iPhone 15 and follow the initial setup prompts until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” display.

Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice.

Then, select Photos and turn on the switch next to “Sync this [device].” Otherwise, go to iCloud settings &gt; iCloud Drive, and switch on “Sync this iPhone.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-pc-1.jpg"                      alt="Sync iCloud photos on iPhone."                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set up your iCloud for Windows.</p><p>Open iCloud for Windows and ensure you’re signed in with your Apple ID. Next to Photos, select Options &gt; iCloud Photos. Click “Done” and “Apply” to save the changes and close the window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-pc-2.jpg"                      alt="Set up iCloud for Windows."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Keep iPhone photos on PC.</p><p>Open iCloud Photos and select the images you want to transfer to your PC. Right-click to open a drop-down menu and choose “Always keep on this device.”</p><p>That’s it! Now, you can find your iPhone Photos on your computer.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Pictures-From-iPhone-with-Google-Drive"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Pictures-From-iPhone-with-Google-Drive" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with Google Drive"></a><strong>Part 2: How To Transfer Pictures From iPhone with Google Drive</strong></h2><p>Another convenient way <strong>to transfer iPhone pics to a computer</strong> is through Google Drive. As a cloud-based storage solution, Google Drive allows users to seamlessly store, manage, and share files, including photos, across different devices.</p><p>If you already have a Google account, you can jump right into Google Drive without signing up. However, be aware that the free version only gives you 15 GB of space. If you need more room, you’ll have to sign up for a subscription.</p><p><strong>How to transfer iPhone pictures to a computer</strong> with Google Drive:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Set up your Google Drive.</p><p>Open Google Drive on your iPhone.

These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Quick-Start"><a href="#Method-1-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Quick Start"></a>Method 1. Quick Start</h3><p>The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 15 devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone</strong> using Quick Start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the “Set Up New iPhone” prompt appears, tap “Unlock to Continue.” This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap “Continue” if you’re comfortable with that.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock new iphone"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> An animation will appear on the new iPhone’s screen, and you have to hold this animation up to the camera on your old iPhone. Once the message “Finish on New [Device]“ appears, input your old iPhone’s passcode into the new one and follow the provided setup instructions.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="setup new iphone using passcode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you reach the “Transfer Your Data” screen, opt for “Transfer Directly from iPhone” and confirm the specific settings and data you wish to transfer. This streamlined process ensures a smooth transition to your new device while maintaining the data you want.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="transfer data from iphone"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-2-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 2. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><pre><code>Another reliable method to transfer data between iPhones is using iTunes/Finder. iTunes is available for Windows or macOS versions before Catalina.

You don’t need to worry a lot about the compatibility issues of different systems and can replace old phones at will when there is a new phone release, like the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S22 series. You can use a third-party app, a cloud service (like iCloud), and iTunes. Read on to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android in 5 different ways.</p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQ2GLxnD-TI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Transfer-all-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-in-1-click"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-all-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-in-1-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Transfer all contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android in 1 click"></a>Part 1: Transfer all contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android in 1 click</h2><p>The easiest way to transfer all the iPhone contacts to Android is by using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit can easily transfer all your data from one device to another with a single click. The application is compatible with every leading Android and iPhone model. You can transfer your data from Apple iPhone XR to Android and vice-versa. Besides a cross-platform transfer of data, <strong>iPhone to iPhone and Android to Android transfer</strong> is also supported.</p><p>The application also supports transferring all the leading data types such as videos, music, photos, messages, and so much more. Extremely easy to use, it is a must-have tool for every smartphone user out there. To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android. Make sure that both the Apple iPhone XR devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message. In the end, you can remove the 2 devices safely from your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-5.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-remove both the Apple iPhone XR devices from your system"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-with-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-with-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android with Google Account"></a>Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android with Google Account</h2><p>Another fast and hassle-free way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android is by using your Google Account. Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone XR device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone XR or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone XR and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard.

By using this method, you can transition from iOS to Android effortlessly. This even ensures that your important contacts, messages, and media move to your new Samsung device. The step-by-step process below outlines the detailed procedure for the hassle-free transfer of your data:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure both devices are charged, and then turn on your Samsung device. Insert a SIM card, connect the Apple iPhone XR device to a Wi-Fi network, and set it up until it asks you to connect the Apple iPhone XR devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="set up android phone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, connect both devices with a compatible USB cable and choose the “Trust” option on your iPhone. You might be required to enter your iPhone passcode a few times. Then, log into your Google account on the Samsung device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="trust the connected device"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> After logging in, it is time to choose the data you want to transfer from your iPhone. Choose the data on your Samsung device and hit the “Copy” button to begin the process. Once data has been transferred, don’t forget to turn off iMessage on your iPhone when prompted by hitting the “Done” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="copy selected data to android"                ></p><p><strong>Data Can Be Transferred:</strong> Contacts, Photos, Videos, Calendar Events, Messages, Apps, Music, Call Logs, Alarms, and more.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-transfer-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Samsung-using-email"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-transfer-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Samsung-using-email" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung using email?"></a>Part 5: How to transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung using email?</h2><p>When manually migrating data from an iPhone to a Samsung device, email can be a viable option. This method is best suited for smaller quantities of data due to email attachment limitations. It’s effective for transferring photos, documents, contacts, or smaller files. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help with this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your iPhone, navigate to the data you want to transfer and long-press to select it. Then, tap the “Share” icon in the drop-down list and choose to send via “Email.” Open your email app on your iPhone and create a new email. Following this, type your email address in the “To” field to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="select mail to share data"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Attach the selected files to the email. Once all the files are attached, send the email to yourself. Open the “Gmail” app on your Samsung device and access the email you sent yourself from the iPhone. Next, open the email and download the attached files to your Samsung device. You can download them by tapping the “Download” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="download the attached files"                ></p><p><strong>Data Can Be Transferred:</strong> Photos, Documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.), Contact vCards (individual contacts), Notes or Text-based Information, Small Video Files, or Audio Recordings.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-transfer-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Samsung-manually"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-transfer-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Samsung-manually" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung manually?"></a>Part 6: How to transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung manually?</h2><p>If you are interested in moving from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung, then you can easily follow this part.

Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 11 to iPhone</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Quick-Start"><a href="#Method-1-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Quick Start"></a>Method 1. Quick Start</h3><p>The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 11 devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone 11 to iPhone</strong> using Quick Start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the “Set Up New iPhone” prompt appears, tap “Unlock to Continue.” This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap “Continue” if you’re comfortable with that.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock new iphone"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> An animation will appear on the new iPhone’s screen, and you have to hold this animation up to the camera on your old iPhone. Once the message “Finish on New [Device]“ appears, input your old iPhone’s passcode into the new one and follow the provided setup instructions.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="setup new iphone using passcode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you reach the “Transfer Your Data” screen, opt for “Transfer Directly from iPhone” and confirm the specific settings and data you wish to transfer. This streamlined process ensures a smooth transition to your new device while maintaining the data you want.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="transfer data from iphone"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-2-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 2. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><pre><code>Another reliable method to transfer data between iPhones is using iTunes/Finder. iTunes is available for Windows or macOS versions before Catalina.

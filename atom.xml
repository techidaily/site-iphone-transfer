After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts.

It ensures that conversations and attachments transfer from one iPhone to another smoothly. iOS offers iCloud as the method to achieve this synchronization. It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is <strong>how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone</strong> via iCloud sync:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press “iCloud” to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="access icloud in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, tap “Show All” under the “Apps Using iCloud” section and press “Messages in iCloud.” On the ensuing screen, toggle on “Use on this iPhone” and then press the “Sync Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="sync messages in icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, move to the target device and access “iCloud” settings through the Settings app. Here, navigate to “Messages in iCloud,” and on the next screen, enable “Use on this iPhone.” Give it some time, and the messages on both devices will sync.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="toggle switch to sync messages"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Using iCloud Backup</h2><p>Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can’t restore messages selectively with this method. Here is <strong>how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone</strong> using iCloud backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open “Settings,” tap on your name, and select “iCloud.” Tap “iCloud Backup” and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on icloud backup switch"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, press “Back Up Now” to initiate an immediate backup and wait for the process to complete.

The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone’s data, including messages.</p><p>Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process.

This process ensures your contacts are effortlessly moved between devices.

Follow these simple yet effective steps to migrate your contacts successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-1.jpg"                      alt="ipod thic pc"                ></p><h2 id="4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>We will start by exploring the 4 basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud. Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share.

However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

However, restoring an iCloud backup to Android devices is not as simple. iCloud only allows restoring the entire backup to iOS device setup, and it doesn’t support restoring backups to Android devices. The iCloud Manager feature in Wondershare Dr.Fone offers a solution to address this limitation.</p><p>It allows selective content restoration from iCloud backups to Samsung devices without alteration. Learn how to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung</strong> via iCloud backup data with the help of the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1: Access Wondershare Dr.Fone and Plugin Samsung Device</strong></li></ul><p>To begin with, open the Wondershare Dr.Fone software on your system and connect your Samsung device to it.

The progress bar will appear and display the progress of the restoration of iCloud data to Samsung devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/icloud-manager-10.png"                      alt="start the transfer process"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3: Finish the Data Restoration Process on Your Samsung Device</strong></li></ul><p>The process will conclude within a few minutes and display the final message of completion.

What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?</h2><p>Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3. Galaxy Z Fold 6</h3><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4. Galaxy A55 5G"></a>4. Galaxy A55 5G</h3><p>Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 series.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983551">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983551">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983551%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983551/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung.</strong> However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users.

Have you ever wondered if there is a more affordable way to own the latest iPhone? If yes, then you are at the right place.</p><p>You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png"                      alt="A picture of a second-hand iPhone."                ></p><p>In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones.

If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.</p><p>When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 6 device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn’t go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 6 device’s functions to stop. Moreover, it’s also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone.

You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase.

If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 6 from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source.

Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3. Galaxy Z Fold 6</h3><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4. Galaxy A55 5G"></a>4. Galaxy A55 5G</h3><p>Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 series.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XS Max to Samsung.</strong> However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone XS Max device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone XS Max or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a fairly barebones unpowered antenna that utilizes the same paper-thin rectangular design that can be found on some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-tv-antennas-to-buy-4078201" >best TV antennas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the market. This design comes with its share of pros (easy setup, not too much clutter) and cons (limited performance, can’t stand on its own).</p><p> Mohu might not be breaking new ground with this antenna, but it’s more than sufficient for most city dwellers and perhaps even a few buyers in the suburbs with a relatively unobstructed path to the broadcast source.</p><h2 id="Design-Basic-but-effective"><a href="#Design-Basic-but-effective" class="headerlink" title="Design: Basic but effective"></a><strong>Design: Basic but effective</strong></h2><p> You can find a dozen identical versions of this unpowered antenna by doing a quick search for TV antennas online, and not for no reason. It’s a very uncomplicated design, doesn’t take up too much space, and doesn’t have a lot of points of failure. The 9x11.5-inch rectangular antenna surface is thin, pliable, and features two small punch-holes towards the top which can be used to pin the antenna to an appropriate surface.</p><p> The matte surface is white on one side and black on the other, which could be useful for helping blend the device in with your surroundings. The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is neither the thickest or the thinnest version of this design that we’ve seen. Some are closer to paper thin and extremely flexible, and others were more rigid. If you need to be able to bend the antenna quite a bit to fit it where you need to, this might not be the right one for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Dead-simple"><a href="#Setup-Dead-simple" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Dead simple"></a><strong>Setup: Dead simple</strong></h2><p> Setup of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is as easy as it gets with antennas. Since there is no external power to connect, you only need to worry about connecting the included coaxial cable to the device and to your TV and using the included pins or adhesive tabs to affix the device to a surface. Ease of setup is one of the benefits of a non-amplified antenna such as the Mohu Leaf.</p><h2 id="Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible"><a href="#Performance-Acceptable-but-not-incredible" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Acceptable but not incredible"></a><strong>Performance: Acceptable but not incredible</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna wasn’t the highest performing antenna that I tested, even among similar unpowered antennas. In my channel acquisition test, the Leaf picked up 56 channels on average across all the iterations performed.</p><p> My apartment is located within city limits and doesn’t provide too much of a challenge for antennas, but I was able to reliably get as many as 76 channels from other devices. Nonetheless, the Leaf still provided a clear picture of all the major network stations without any issue. The only channels that I couldn’t pick up with the Leaf were pretty obscure, such as an audio-only station from a Korean Christian church. I think I’ll be okay without that one.</p><h2 id="Range-Fairly-limited"><a href="#Range-Fairly-limited" class="headerlink" title="Range: Fairly limited"></a><strong>Range: Fairly limited</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is rated, as its name implies, for up to 30 miles of range. This is about what I would expect from an unpowered antenna. This device is clearly designed for buyers who live within close proximity to their local TV broadcast source, and not for those further out into the suburbs and beyond.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-performance"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-performance" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the performance"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the performance</strong></h2><p> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna has a 90-day rolling average price of $29 on Amazon, which puts it on the more affordable end of the spectrum. The price definitely feels appropriate for the performance and feature set, but it’s not an all-out bargain.</p><p> Buyers probably wouldn’t be wise to spend more money unless they live a bit further from their signal source and have had trouble with similar antennas in the past. I think that for most people living in cities, the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna should be more than enough.</p><h2 id="Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna"><a href="#Mohu-Leaf-30-TV-Antenna-vs-Mohu-Blade-TV-Antenna" class="headerlink" title="Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna"></a><strong>Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna vs Mohu Blade TV Antenna</strong></h2><p> Mohu also makes the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/mohu-blade-tv-antenna-review-4843106" >Mohu Blade <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a powered antenna with a slightly more unique design for a minor premium of $40. This antenna managed to reliably acquire an average of 69 channels in my tests, a big leap from the performance of the Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna. That having been said, the Blade does require a power source, and installation is slightly more cumbersome than that of the Leaf. If I wasn’t having any trouble getting the channels I watch with the Leaf, I probably wouldn’t upgrade to the Blade personally.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>No fuss, good value.</strong><br> The Mohu Leaf 30 TV Antenna is a great entry point into the TV antenna space, providing a nice mix of performance and value in a dead-simple package that won’t burden buyers during setup. It might not be powerful enough to suit the needs of suburban users and beyond, but if you’re close enough to the signal source, it’s a nice option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Leaf 30</li><li>Product Brand  Mohu</li><li>Price  $32.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2011</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.5 x 11.7 x 1.5 in.</li><li>Color  White</li><li>Powered  No</li><li>Range  30 miles</li><li>Warranty  One year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-leveraging-view-counts-for-financial-freedom-online/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Leveraging View Counts for Financial Freedom Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/024-approved-tap-into-endless-stock-imagery-through-favorite-4-youtube-vids/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Tap Into Endless Stock Imagery Through Favorite 4 Youtube Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-buy-top-10-gaming-gpus-for-high-quality-online-viewing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best Buy Top 10 Gaming GPUs for High-Quality Online Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-elevate-your-videos-impact-with-customizable-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevate Your Video's Impact with Customizable YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-speedy-solution-8-best-slow-mo-video-enhancers/"><u>[Updated] Speedy Solution 8 Best Slow-Mo Video Enhancers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/4-ingenious-ways-to-save-on-gaming-expenses/"><u>4 Ingenious Ways to Save on Gaming Expenses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-transfer-contacts-from-apple-iphone-se-2020-to-iphone-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>4 Ways to Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone Quickly | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/4-ways-to-transfer-music-from-apple-iphone-14-to-ipod-touch-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>4 Ways to Transfer Music from Apple iPhone 14 to iPod touch | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-send-ringtones-from-apple-iphone-6-to-iphone-including-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>5 Ways to Send Ringtones from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Including iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-everything-from-apple-iphone-se-2020-to-iphone-8x11-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>How to Transfer Everything from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone 8/X/11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-ways-to-transfer-messages-from-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-to-iphone-including-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, 4 Ways to Transfer Messages from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone Including iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-ways-to-transfer-messages-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-to-iphone-including-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, 4 Ways to Transfer Messages from Apple iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone Including iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-ways-to-transfer-data-from-your-apple-iphone-15-plus-to-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Ways to Transfer Data from Your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-fix-apple-iphone-15-stuck-on-data-transfer-verified-solution-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, Fix Apple iPhone 15 Stuck on Data Transfer Verified Solution!

With their use from the inception of smartphones, SIM cards are associated with every significant cellular operation. All major functions, such as cellular calling, messaging, and cellular internet, are obtained through SIM cards. Whether you are using an iPhone or an Android, using a SIM card is standard.</p><p>If you are seeking to change your iPhone, you will have to shift everything, including the SIM cards. For that, the article discusses a guide explaining <strong>how to switch SIM cards in Apple iPhone 14 and other iPhones</strong> properly. Look through the discussion for better awareness of <strong>switching SIM cards between Apple iPhone 14 and other iPhones.</strong> The implications of shifting SIM cards and other details will be focused on throughout the discussion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/03/switch-sim-cards-between-iphones-1.jpg"                      alt="switch sim card featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-To-Know-Before-Switching-SIM-Cards-in-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Things-To-Know-Before-Switching-SIM-Cards-in-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things To Know Before Switching SIM Cards in iPhone"></a>Part 1: Things To Know Before Switching SIM Cards in iPhone</h2><p>Whenever you consider switching your SIM card to iPhone, you must keep a few things in mind. Considering these points will help you in avoiding all forms of discrepancies that can occur on your iOS device:</p><ul><li><strong>Compatibility of SIM Card:</strong> You have to ensure that the SIM card is compatible with your iPhone. Some SIM cards do not operate on Apple iPhone 14 and other iPhones since they are incompatible.</li><li><strong>Unlocked iPhone:</strong> If you have an unlocked iPhone, you can utilize third-party SIM cards for this purpose. An unlocked iPhone is a best-case scenario for using such SIMs.</li><li><strong>Backup iPhone Data:</strong> Although there is no direct involvement of iPhone data in the process, it is best to back up the data. It includes all essential contacts and media that might get physically damaged while changing SIM cards.</li><li><strong>Turn Off iPhone While Switching SIM Cards:</strong> It is best to turn off your iOS device during such processes. To avoid any software anomaly, turning off the Apple iPhone 14 device can save you the drill.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happens-If-You-Switch-Two-SIM-Cards-in-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happens-If-You-Switch-Two-SIM-Cards-in-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happens If You Switch Two SIM Cards in iPhone"></a>Part 2: What Happens If You Switch Two SIM Cards in iPhone</h2><p>On <strong>switching a SIM card to a new iPhone,</strong> there are multiple consequences that occur against it. The provided details explain the possible situations that can arise if you consider switching SIM cards in iPhone:</p><ol><li>SIM cards usually contain contacts from the previous device it is contained in. There is a possibility that the contacts present in the SIM card might be transferred into the new iPhone. On attaching the SIM card to the iPhone, the contacts will be automatically transferred.</li><li>The cellular network, along with other cellular packages, will be in operational use as the SIM card will be attached to the iPhone. You will be paying according to the packages offered by your SIM carrier.</li><li>If the SIM card is not compatible with the iPhone, the network operations will malfunction and not operate properly.

Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard.

Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 14 Plus model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 14 Plus comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943648/22993" target="_top" id="1943648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943648/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1013424/11832" target="_top" id="1013424">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1013424" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1013424/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone XR to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone XR to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the “Backups” section in the “Summary” tab. Here, tap “Restore Backup” and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap “Restore” and wait for the backup to be restored.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="restore the iphone backup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135363/19272" target="_top" id="2135363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135363/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner.

It ensures that conversations and attachments transfer from one iPhone to another smoothly. iOS offers iCloud as the method to achieve this synchronization. It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is <strong>how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone</strong> via iCloud sync:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press “iCloud” to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="access icloud in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, tap “Show All” under the “Apps Using iCloud” section and press “Messages in iCloud.” On the ensuing screen, toggle on “Use on this iPhone” and then press the “Sync Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="sync messages in icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, move to the target device and access “iCloud” settings through the Settings app. Here, navigate to “Messages in iCloud,” and on the next screen, enable “Use on this iPhone.” Give it some time, and the messages on both devices will sync.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="toggle switch to sync messages"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Using iCloud Backup"></a>Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Using iCloud Backup</h2><p>Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can’t restore messages selectively with this method. Here is <strong>how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone</strong> using iCloud backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open “Settings,” tap on your name, and select “iCloud.” Tap “iCloud Backup” and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on icloud backup switch"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, press “Back Up Now” to initiate an immediate backup and wait for the process to complete. Afterward, move to the new iPhone and start setting it up until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="back up now button icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next, opt for “Restore from iCloud Backup.” Then, log in to your iCloud account with the identical credentials employed during the backup process. Pick the latest backup from the available options, including the messages you aim to transfer. The restoration process will begin, and once it’s completed, open the Messages app to verify that all your message history has been transferred.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="restore data from recent icloud backup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h2><p>Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone’s data, including messages.</p><p>Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone</strong> via iTunes&#x2F;Finder backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device to access the “Summary” tab, while in Finder, access the “General” tab. Here, go to “Backups” and choose “Back Up Now” to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either “This Computer” (for iTunes) or “Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac” (for Finder).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="create backup in itunes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the backup is completed, start setting up your new iPhone.

It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3727260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713322&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVRadio1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV Radio Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Samsung phones offer more customization options regarding the software compared to iPhones. One of the major issues iPhone users face is limited storage, which can be avoided by using Samsung.</p><p>If the only thing stopping you from switching is the stress of transferring your data, you don’t have to worry anymore. In this article, we will discover various aspects to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung</strong>. Different methods and prerequisites to be fulfilled will be covered ahead. Moreover, we’ll also provide you with the best one-click method for <strong>transferring your iPhone to Samsung</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone to samsung"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Pre-Requirements-To-Fulfill-Before-Transferring-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Pre-Requirements-To-Fulfill-Before-Transferring-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are the Pre-Requirements To Fulfill Before Transferring From Apple iPhone XS to Samsung?"></a>Part 1: What Are the Pre-Requirements To Fulfill Before Transferring From Apple iPhone XS to Samsung?</h2><p>Before we discuss different methods to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung</strong>, there are some things that you should not neglect. These attributes must be fulfilled before switching to ensure a smooth transition. That’s why we want you to look at these prerequisites and fulfill them before moving to your new device. Here’s a checklist of these pre-requirements before <strong>transferring the iPhone to Samsung</strong>.</p><ol><li><strong>Backup Your iPhone:</strong> First of all, you have to ensure you have backed up your iPhone before proceeding with data transfer. This step will secure your data from losing or deleting it. Moreover, you can access it from any device whenever you need to. You can perform the backup by turning on the iCloud backup option from the iPhone.</li><li><strong>Battery Percentage:</strong> Another critical aspect is to charge both your iPhone and Samsung device to an adequate battery level. This will prevent any interruption due to low battery during the transfer process. Also, the performance of the Apple iPhone XS devices will be optimum at the ideal battery percentage.</li><li><strong>Update Software:</strong> Furthermore, you should confirm that both your iPhone and Samsung devices are running the latest operating system software. You must update your iPhone to the latest iOS version and your Samsung device to the latest Android version.</li><li><strong>Secure Your Data:</strong> When you are done with the transferring process, it is necessary to clear your data from the old phone. Although the iPhone is one of the most secure devices, you should reset it before leaving. This will ensure that no one can access your files after you have wiped off all your data.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-to-Samsung-Using-Smart-Switch-App"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-to-Samsung-Using-Smart-Switch-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone XS to Samsung Using Smart Switch App"></a>Part 2: How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone XS to Samsung Using Smart Switch App</h2><p>Samsung Smart Switch tool is designed to simplify transferring various types of data from an iPhone to a Samsung.

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

The step-by-step process below outlines the detailed procedure for the hassle-free transfer of your data:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure both devices are charged, and then turn on your Samsung device. Insert a SIM card, connect the Apple iPhone XS device to a Wi-Fi network, and set it up until it asks you to connect the Apple iPhone XS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="set up android phone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, connect both devices with a compatible USB cable and choose the “Trust” option on your iPhone.

This method is best suited for smaller quantities of data due to email attachment limitations. It’s effective for transferring photos, documents, contacts, or smaller files. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help with this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your iPhone, navigate to the data you want to transfer and long-press to select it. Then, tap the “Share” icon in the drop-down list and choose to send via “Email.” Open your email app on your iPhone and create a new email. Following this, type your email address in the “To” field to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="select mail to share data"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Attach the selected files to the email.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone XS device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone XS you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone XS model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone XS comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone.

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XS Max to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?</h2><p>Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3.

Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4. Galaxy A55 5G"></a>4. Galaxy A55 5G</h3><p>Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 series.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XS Max to Samsung.</strong> However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users.

Choose the “Photos” tab and let Wondershare Dr.Fone load all the pictures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-ios-2.png"                      alt="choose your old iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2: Perform the Selective Photos Transfer</strong></p><p>Once Dr.Fone detects all the photos in your iPhone, it will categorize them in the albums like they are in your iDevice. Choose the pictures you want to transfer and tap the “To Device” option. Then, click on the iPhone on which you want to send all the selected images and complete the photo transfer process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/manage-ios-photos-2.png"                      alt="transfer the selected images"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-3-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-iTunes-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-3-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-iTunes-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data. In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the “Backups” section in the “Summary” tab. Here, tap “Restore Backup” and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap “Restore” and wait for the backup to be restored.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="restore the iphone backup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner. Unlike iCloud or iTunes, it does not need to sync all the photos. You just have to select the photos from one of your iPhones and AirDrop them to another. However, the other iPhone should be within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range of the host iDevice. Here are the instructions you need to follow to AirDrop photos from old iPhone to new iPhone efficiently:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your old iPhone, you need to open the “Photos” app and hop into the desired folder. Next, pick the photos you want to share by tapping the “Select” button in the upper right corner.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, you will have to tap the “Share” icon, followed by selecting the targeted “AirDrop” recipient iPhone. Then, on the target iPhone, you have to choose “Accept” to receive them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="press the accept button"                ></p><h2 id="Tip-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-using-iCloud"><a href="#Tip-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Tip: How to Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone using iCloud"></a>Tip: How to Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone using iCloud</h2><p>Step 1.

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12730965&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/w5/03_WBSX5_728x90_red_CTA.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera.

The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone.

To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/2016067/18544" target="_top" id="2016067"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-2016067"                      border="0" alt="" width="1020" height="380"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2016067/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone XR to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone XR to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

This will prevent any interruption due to low battery during the transfer process. Also, the performance of the Apple iPhone X devices will be optimum at the ideal battery percentage.</li><li><strong>Update Software:</strong> Furthermore, you should confirm that both your iPhone and Samsung devices are running the latest operating system software. You must update your iPhone to the latest iOS version and your Samsung device to the latest Android version.</li><li><strong>Secure Your Data:</strong> When you are done with the transferring process, it is necessary to clear your data from the old phone. Although the iPhone is one of the most secure devices, you should reset it before leaving. This will ensure that no one can access your files after you have wiped off all your data.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Samsung-Using-Smart-Switch-App"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Samsung-Using-Smart-Switch-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone X to Samsung Using Smart Switch App"></a>Part 2: How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone X to Samsung Using Smart Switch App</h2><p>Samsung Smart Switch tool is designed to simplify transferring various types of data from an iPhone to a Samsung.

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone X to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung-1"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone X to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone X from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone X device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone X you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone X model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone X comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Samsung phones offer more customization options regarding the software compared to iPhones. One of the major issues iPhone users face is limited storage, which can be avoided by using Samsung.</p><p>If the only thing stopping you from switching is the stress of transferring your data, you don’t have to worry anymore. In this article, we will discover various aspects to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone SE to Samsung</strong>. Different methods and prerequisites to be fulfilled will be covered ahead. Moreover, we’ll also provide you with the best one-click method for <strong>transferring your iPhone to Samsung</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-samsung-1.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone to samsung"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Pre-Requirements-To-Fulfill-Before-Transferring-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Pre-Requirements-To-Fulfill-Before-Transferring-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Are the Pre-Requirements To Fulfill Before Transferring From Apple iPhone SE to Samsung?"></a>Part 1: What Are the Pre-Requirements To Fulfill Before Transferring From Apple iPhone SE to Samsung?</h2><p>Before we discuss different methods to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone SE to Samsung</strong>, there are some things that you should not neglect. These attributes must be fulfilled before switching to ensure a smooth transition. That’s why we want you to look at these prerequisites and fulfill them before moving to your new device. Here’s a checklist of these pre-requirements before <strong>transferring the iPhone to Samsung</strong>.</p><ol><li><strong>Backup Your iPhone:</strong> First of all, you have to ensure you have backed up your iPhone before proceeding with data transfer. This step will secure your data from losing or deleting it. Moreover, you can access it from any device whenever you need to. You can perform the backup by turning on the iCloud backup option from the iPhone.</li><li><strong>Battery Percentage:</strong> Another critical aspect is to charge both your iPhone and Samsung device to an adequate battery level. This will prevent any interruption due to low battery during the transfer process. Also, the performance of the Apple iPhone SE devices will be optimum at the ideal battery percentage.</li><li><strong>Update Software:</strong> Furthermore, you should confirm that both your iPhone and Samsung devices are running the latest operating system software. You must update your iPhone to the latest iOS version and your Samsung device to the latest Android version.</li><li><strong>Secure Your Data:</strong> When you are done with the transferring process, it is necessary to clear your data from the old phone. Although the iPhone is one of the most secure devices, you should reset it before leaving. This will ensure that no one can access your files after you have wiped off all your data.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-to-Samsung-Using-Smart-Switch-App"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-to-Samsung-Using-Smart-Switch-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone SE to Samsung Using Smart Switch App"></a>Part 2: How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone SE to Samsung Using Smart Switch App</h2><p>Samsung Smart Switch tool is designed to simplify transferring various types of data from an iPhone to a Samsung.

What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?<p>Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3. Galaxy Z Fold 6</h3><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4. Galaxy A55 5G"></a>4. Galaxy A55 5G</h3><p>Samsung usually unveils new Galaxy A phone versions in March. Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 series.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone SE to Samsung.</strong> However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users.

It often arises during device upgrades, replacements, or when sharing information between devices. With the evolution of iOS versions, the methods for transferring messages have also adapted and improved. Regardless of the version, transferring messages between iPhones remains vital and relevant.</p><p>This guide will go through many techniques to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone</strong>. Our goal is to provide you with the necessary knowledge for transferring your messages between two iPhones.

It ensures that conversations and attachments transfer from one iPhone to another smoothly. iOS offers iCloud as the method to achieve this synchronization. It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is <strong>how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone</strong> via iCloud sync:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press “iCloud” to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="access icloud in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, tap “Show All” under the “Apps Using iCloud” section and press “Messages in iCloud.” On the ensuing screen, toggle on “Use on this iPhone” and then press the “Sync Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="sync messages in icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, move to the target device and access “iCloud” settings through the Settings app. Here, navigate to “Messages in iCloud,” and on the next screen, enable “Use on this iPhone.” Give it some time, and the messages on both devices will sync.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="toggle switch to sync messages"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone Using iCloud Backup"></a>Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone Using iCloud Backup</h2><p>Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can’t restore messages selectively with this method. Here is <strong>how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone</strong> using iCloud backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open “Settings,” tap on your name, and select “iCloud.” Tap “iCloud Backup” and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on icloud backup switch"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, press “Back Up Now” to initiate an immediate backup and wait for the process to complete. Afterward, move to the new iPhone and start setting it up until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="back up now button icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next, opt for “Restore from iCloud Backup.” Then, log in to your iCloud account with the identical credentials employed during the backup process. Pick the latest backup from the available options, including the messages you aim to transfer. The restoration process will begin, and once it’s completed, open the Messages app to verify that all your message history has been transferred.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="restore data from recent icloud backup"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h2><p>Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone’s data, including messages.</p><p>Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone</strong> via iTunes&#x2F;Finder backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device to access the “Summary” tab, while in Finder, access the “General” tab. Here, go to “Backups” and choose “Back Up Now” to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either “This Computer” (for iTunes) or “Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac” (for Finder).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="create backup in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the backup is completed, start setting up your new iPhone. Once you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen, select “Restore from Mac or PC,” and follow this guide:</li></ul><p><strong>For Finder&#x2F;iTunes:</strong> Link your iPhone to the PC and gain access by clicking on the “Device” icon at the top left corner. This action will lead you to the “Welcome to Your New iPhone” screen, where the “Restore from this backup” option is pre-selected. Here, choose the desired backup and click “Continue” to kickstart the backup restoration process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="retore back up in itunes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-Way-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPhone-Without-Resetting"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-Way-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPhone-Without-Resetting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The Best Way To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone Without Resetting"></a>Part 4. The Best Way To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPhone Without Resetting</h2><p>iCloud and iTunes are viable options for transferring messages, but both need an entire device reset. However, synchronization of devices is limited to those sharing the same Apple ID.

It ensures that conversations and attachments transfer from one iPhone to another smoothly. iOS offers iCloud as the method to achieve this synchronization. It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is <strong>how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone</strong> via iCloud sync:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press “iCloud” to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="access icloud in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, tap “Show All” under the “Apps Using iCloud” section and press “Messages in iCloud.” On the ensuing screen, toggle on “Use on this iPhone” and then press the “Sync Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="sync messages in icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, move to the target device and access “iCloud” settings through the Settings app. Here, navigate to “Messages in iCloud,” and on the next screen, enable “Use on this iPhone.” Give it some time, and the messages on both devices will sync.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="toggle switch to sync messages"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone Using iCloud Backup"></a>Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone Using iCloud Backup</h2><p>Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can’t restore messages selectively with this method. Here is <strong>how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone</strong> using iCloud backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open “Settings,” tap on your name, and select “iCloud.” Tap “iCloud Backup” and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on icloud backup switch"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, press “Back Up Now” to initiate an immediate backup and wait for the process to complete. Afterward, move to the new iPhone and start setting it up until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="back up now button icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next, opt for “Restore from iCloud Backup.” Then, log in to your iCloud account with the identical credentials employed during the backup process. Pick the latest backup from the available options, including the messages you aim to transfer. The restoration process will begin, and once it’s completed, open the Messages app to verify that all your message history has been transferred.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="restore data from recent icloud backup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h2><p>Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone’s data, including messages.</p><p>Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone SE (2020) to iPhone</strong> via iTunes&#x2F;Finder backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to access the “Summary” tab, while in Finder, access the “General” tab. Here, go to “Backups” and choose “Back Up Now” to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either “This Computer” (for iTunes) or “Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac” (for Finder).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="create backup in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the backup is completed, start setting up your new iPhone. Once you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen, select “Restore from Mac or PC,” and follow this guide:</li></ul><p><strong>For Finder&#x2F;iTunes:</strong> Link your iPhone to the PC and gain access by clicking on the “Device” icon at the top left corner. This action will lead you to the “Welcome to Your New iPhone” screen, where the “Restore from this backup” option is pre-selected. Here, choose the desired backup and click “Continue” to kickstart the backup restoration process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="retore back up in itunes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-Way-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-to-iPhone-Without-Resetting"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-Way-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-to-iPhone-Without-Resetting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

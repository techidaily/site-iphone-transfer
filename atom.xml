It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.</p><h3 id="How-to-Activate-Shared-Album"><a href="#How-to-Activate-Shared-Album" class="headerlink" title="How to Activate Shared Album?"></a>How to Activate Shared Album?</h3><p>Here’s how to activate Shared Album on Settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click your Apple ID Profile.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click iCloud.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Photos.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Toggle on the radio button next to Shared Albums.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="shared album settings"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos"><a href="#How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Shared Albums in Photos"></a>How to Create Shared Albums in Photos</h3><p>Here’s how to create Shared Albums in Photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Photos.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Album tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the + icon at the top-left corner of your screen to add a new folder.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="add new folde"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click New Shared Album.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Rename the Shared Album and then click Create.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone in Easy Steps?"></a>How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone in Easy Steps?</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the Shared Album feature is a very convenient way to move media files from one iPhone to another.

Then you need to find the songs that are on the iPhone, but not in your computer’s iTunes library.  Then, click the ‘cloud’ button next to the song name to download it.  The last step of syncing remains which can be done as desired. Just sync those songs from your iTunes library to your iPod as desired and you are done with the job of Transfer Music Purchased from the iTunes store from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPod.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Music-purchased-from-the-iTunes-Store-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPod-using-iTunes-match"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Music-purchased-from-the-iTunes-Store-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPod-using-iTunes-match" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Transfer Music purchased from the iTunes Store from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPod using iTunes match"></a>Part 3: Transfer Music purchased from the iTunes Store from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPod using iTunes match</h2><p>iTunes match is another way to process of transfer music purchased or unpurchased from iTunes from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPod.

This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings.

However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit can easily transfer all your data from one device to another with a single click. The application is compatible with every leading Android and iPhone model. You can transfer your data from Apple iPhone 6 to Android and vice-versa. Besides a cross-platform transfer of data, <strong>iPhone to iPhone and Android to Android transfer</strong> is also supported.</p><p>The application also supports transferring all the leading data types such as videos, music, photos, messages, and so much more. Extremely easy to use, it is a must-have tool for every smartphone user out there. To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android. Make sure that both the Apple iPhone 6 devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message. In the end, you can remove the 2 devices safely from your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-5.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-remove both the Apple iPhone 6 devices from your system"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-with-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-with-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android with Google Account"></a>Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android with Google Account</h2><p>Another fast and hassle-free way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android is by using your Google Account. Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 6 device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 6 or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 15 device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 15 or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-writer-free-word-processor-1x.3d9c80d.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 15 and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard. In this way, all the saved contacts will be exported to your Apple iPhone 15.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-14.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-restore your contacts"                ></p><p>Now that you have learned 7 different ways to move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts.

Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4572700&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.tubedigger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tubedigger-software-new.png"                      border="0"                >TubeDigger - online video downloader from mostly any site</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup.

Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process.

These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider.

The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 15 Plus you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 15 Plus model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 15 Plus comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal.

You don’t need to worry a lot about the compatibility issues of different systems and can replace old phones at will when there is a new phone release, like the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S22 series. You can use a third-party app, a cloud service (like iCloud), and iTunes.

A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit can easily transfer all your data from one device to another with a single click. The application is compatible with every leading Android and iPhone model. You can transfer your data from Apple iPhone 14 to Android and vice-versa. Besides a cross-platform transfer of data, <strong>iPhone to iPhone and Android to Android transfer</strong> is also supported.</p><p>The application also supports transferring all the leading data types such as videos, music, photos, messages, and so much more. Extremely easy to use, it is a must-have tool for every smartphone user out there. To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android. Make sure that both the Apple iPhone 14 devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message. In the end, you can remove the 2 devices safely from your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-5.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-remove both the Apple iPhone 14 devices from your system"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-with-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-with-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android with Google Account"></a>Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android with Google Account</h2><p>Another fast and hassle-free way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android is by using your Google Account. Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 14 device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 14 or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it.

With eSIMs, the process of switching between devices is typically smoother compared to physical SIM cards. The reason is it involves digital activation and can be done remotely without the need to swap cards physically.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Is there a difference between switching physical SIM cards and using eSIM for transferring phone services between Apple iPhone 14 and other iPhones?</strong></li></ol><p>Physical SIM cards are tangible, removable chips that need to be inserted into a SIM card tray, whereas eSIMs are integrated directly into the Apple iPhone 14 device’s hardware. Swapping physical SIM cards involves physically removing and inserting the card into the new device, whereas transferring an eSIM between devices can be done remotely. Physical SIM cards can store limited contact information and some network settings, whereas eSIMs can store multiple network profiles.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article has provided a valuable overview of <strong>switching SIM cards to new Apple iPhone 14 and other iPhones</strong>.

Make sure that both the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

The more recent versions exclusively support music synchronization. Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to transfer ringtones from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to iPhone</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by installing iTunes version 12.6 or older on your computer and launch it. Now connect your old iPhone with ringtone to the computer. In iTunes, click “Files,” hover over “Devices,” and tap “Transfer Purchases from iPhone.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/send-ringtone-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose transfer purchases from iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press “Sync” and wait for the ringtones to sync. Afterward, disconnect the old iPhone and plug in the new iPhone. Once you’ve selected the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device icon, navigate to the “Tones” tab and mark the “Sync Tones” box. Next, choose either “All Tone” or “Selected Items” and finalize the process by clicking “Apply.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/send-ringtone-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="enable sync tones option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713321&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVDJ1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV DJ Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Send-Ringtones-to-iPhone-including-iPhone-15-using-OneDrive"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Send-Ringtones-to-iPhone-including-iPhone-15-using-OneDrive" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Send Ringtones to iPhone including iPhone 15 using OneDrive?"></a>Part 3: How to Send Ringtones to iPhone including iPhone 15 using OneDrive?</h2><p>With Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, you can transfer ringtones from one device to another directly, and that too within seconds.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android without a computer<p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290"

Extremely easy to use, it is a must-have tool for every smartphone user out there. To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android. Make sure that both the Apple iPhone 13 devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 13 device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 13 or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 13 and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard.

They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 13 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 13 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 13 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal.

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?"></a>Bonus Tip. What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?</h2><p>Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2\. Galaxy Z Flip 6<p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3. Galaxy Z Fold 6</h3><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4.

Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 series.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Samsung.</strong> However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users.

Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 mini to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 mini to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts.

Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts.

Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-12-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-12-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 12 to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android.

By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though?

For it to be done, you need to re-download previous iTunes Store purchases on your computer. The best thing for this to be done, is that no extra cost is required to be done till the time, the same ID is used for the same purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/transfer-music-from-iphone-to-ipod-3.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod - using iTunes"                ></p><p>Then you need to follow the following steps for the process to be done. On the computer, in iTunes, go to the iTunes Store.  Then you need to click ‘Purchased’, which is available in the Quick Links on the <em>Home</em> screen. Then you need to find the songs that are on the iPhone, but not in your computer’s iTunes library.  Then, click the ‘cloud’ button next to the song name to download it.  The last step of syncing remains which can be done as desired. Just sync those songs from your iTunes library to your iPod as desired and you are done with the job of Transfer Music Purchased from the iTunes store from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Music-purchased-from-the-iTunes-Store-from-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPod-using-iTunes-match"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Music-purchased-from-the-iTunes-Store-from-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPod-using-iTunes-match" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Transfer Music purchased from the iTunes Store from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod using iTunes match"></a>Part 3: Transfer Music purchased from the iTunes Store from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod using iTunes match</h2><p>iTunes match is another way to process of transfer music purchased or unpurchased from iTunes from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod. In fact, iTunes match determines the song, which is present in the iCloud and since there are over 43 million songs, iTunes match matches these unpurchased songs with the database and allows playing these music from the iCloud store. Now, you just need to tap the iCloud download button to download music from an artist, album or playlist. Thus, a person has immediate access to a huge music library without having to worry about the storage space on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/transfer-music-from-iphone-to-ipod-4.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod - using iTunes match"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Transfer-Music-imported-from-a-CD-or-other-source-from-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPod"><a href="#Part-4-Transfer-Music-imported-from-a-CD-or-other-source-from-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-to-iPod" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Transfer Music imported from a CD or other source from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod"></a>Part 4: Transfer Music imported from a CD or other source from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to iPod</h2><p>For this process to complete, you need to import all songs from CD to iTunes at first.

It means you need to ensure that your data seamlessly makes the journey to the new iPhone 15. Apple provides a convenient way to transfer your data in the form of iCloud. You can create an iCloud backup of your old device and restore it to the new one. Use the following guide to <strong>transfer to iPhone 15</strong> with iCloud:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone SE (2020) , navigate to “Settings,” tap on your Apple ID, select “iCloud,” and then “iCloud Backup.” Here tap “Back Up Now” to create an iCloud back of your iPhone data.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-1.jpg"                      alt="access icloud backup feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Power on your iPhone 15 and follow the setup prompts until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. Then, proceed with the “Restore from iCloud Backup” feature and sign in using your Apple ID credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> A list of available iCloud backups will appear on the screen. Here you need to select the most recent backup from your Apple iPhone SE (2020) . Keep in mind that a reliable Wi-Fi connection is essential for a smooth and speedy transfer.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-2.jpg"                      alt="choose the required icloud backup"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Data-Directly-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-Data-Directly-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone SE (2020) Data Directly to iPhone 15?"></a>Part 3: How To Transfer Apple iPhone SE (2020) Data Directly to iPhone 15?</h2><p>While iCloud offers a seamless way to transfer data, some users prefer a more direct approach. It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the “Quick Start” method, and you can use it by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone SE (2020) , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping “Continue.” Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-3.jpg"                      alt="press the continue button"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> This animation contains security information and establishes a connection between devices. On the new iPhone, you will be required to provide the old phone passcode. Enter the passcode and log in using your Apple ID. Subsequently, select “Transfer from iPhone” and patiently await the process to finish.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-4.jpg"                      alt="select transfer from iphone feature"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Transfer-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-iTunes-Finder-Backup-to-iPhone-15"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Transfer-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020-iTunes-Finder-Backup-to-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Transfer Apple iPhone SE (2020) iTunes&#x2F;Finder Backup to iPhone 15?"></a>Part 4: How To Transfer Apple iPhone SE (2020) iTunes&#x2F;Finder Backup to iPhone 15?</h2><p>Looking for a more hands-on approach to data transfer? Using iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be an effective way in this scenario. It is a recommended way if you have larger backups stored on your computer. To migrate your data from an old iPhone to the new iPhone 15 with iTunes&#x2F;Finder, you can use the following steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make sure you have the latest version of iTunes&#x2F;Finder installed on your computer. First, connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  to the computer and create a backup through the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab. After the backup has finished, proceed to disconnect the old iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-5.jpg"                      alt="create old iphone backup"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now start setting up the new iPhone 15 and navigate to the “Apps &amp; Data” screen. Here, choose “Restore from Mac or PC” and connect the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to the computer or MacBook with backup.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on restore from mac or pc"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Launch iTunes&#x2F;Finder on the computer after trusting the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and tap the “Device” icon. Then, from the “Welcome to Your New iPhone” screen, enable the “Restore from this backup” option and choose your Apple iPhone SE (2020)  backup file. Afterward, press the “Continue” button to restore the old iPhone backup to your iPhone 15.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-7.jpg"                      alt="choose old iphone backup file"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-Having-Trouble-When-Transferring-to-iPhone-15-Stucks"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-Having-Trouble-When-Transferring-to-iPhone-15-Stucks" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: Having Trouble When Transferring to iPhone 15 Stucks?"></a>Bonus Tips: Having Trouble When Transferring to iPhone 15 Stucks?</h2><p>The issue of iPhone 15 getting stuck when users attempt to transfer data from their older devices, like the iPhone 14, to the new iPhone 15 has become a frustrating challenge for many Apple enthusiasts.

In order to transfer data Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 (Plus)&#x2F;X&#x2F;11 using iCloud, you can consider the following steps to make the process easy.</p><ol><li>Just like iTunes, with iCloud too you need to back up your data to iCloud so that it can be restored to your new iPhone 8 (Plus)&#x2F;X&#x2F;11. In order to back up, first you need to connect the Apple iPhone 7 device to the Wi-Fi network. Then go to the setting, click on iCloud button and then click on to iCloud backup.

However, considering the complexity of the iTunes and iCloud, we’d urge the readers if they can try the Dr.Fone at least once. It is not only easy but also less time consuming. It prevents the additional steps such as backup and restore settings. Rather, the entire process is done with just one click. Dr.Fone is highly user friendly and a bit different from traditional ways of transfer data Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 (Plus)&#x2F;X&#x2F;11.</p><p>We know the emotions and sentiments attached with one’s personal information and thus we have tried to give users a platform, where they can make the transition from one phone to another extremely simple.

To start with, make sure that you have already synced your iPhone music with iTunes. Once it is done, launch iTunes again.</p><p>2. Go to its Preferences &gt; Advanced options and enable the “Copy files to iTunes media folder when adding to library” feature from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/06/transfer-music-from-iphone-to-android-11.jpg"                      alt="transfer music from iphone to android-enable the feature"                ></p><p>3. Once you apply this change, iTunes will make a dedicated folder with all the music files present in its library.

To transfer these music files, connect your Android to the system and choose to use it as a media transfer device.</p><p>5.

Just sync those songs from your iTunes library to your iPod as desired and you are done with the job of Transfer Music Purchased from the iTunes store from Apple iPhone 15 to iPod.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Transfer-Music-purchased-from-the-iTunes-Store-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-iPod-using-iTunes-match"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-Music-purchased-from-the-iTunes-Store-from-Apple-iPhone-15-to-iPod-using-iTunes-match" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Transfer Music purchased from the iTunes Store from Apple iPhone 15 to iPod using iTunes match"></a>Part 3: Transfer Music purchased from the iTunes Store from Apple iPhone 15 to iPod using iTunes match</h2><p>iTunes match is another way to process of transfer music purchased or unpurchased from iTunes from Apple iPhone 15 to iPod.

Why Your iPhone Can‚Äôt Access Mobile Network and What to Do About It</h2><p> You‚Äôre connected to mobile data and notice that new WhatsApp messages aren‚Äôt coming in. Trying to open Twitter only leads to the loading symbol turning endlessly. Then when you try Googling something, the Safari webpage doesn‚Äôt load either. The only message you see is ‚ÄúYour iPhone is not connected to the internet.‚Äù</p><p> Why is your iPhone‚Äôs cellular data not working? Let‚Äôs look at these easy ways to fix your iPhone‚Äôs cellular data problem now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-Your-Data-Plan‚Äôs-Status"><a href="#1-Check-Your-Data-Plan‚Äôs-Status" class="headerlink" title="1.

Did you forget to renew your data plan and it expired? Have you reached your plan‚Äôs mobile data quota for the month?</p><p> If these are the causes, you‚Äôll need to reactivate your mobile plan or top up your quota, then you‚Äôre good to go! Your cellular data should immediately start working again.

After installing this Android app, you can download iCloud data to your ZTE directly, or connect iPhone to ZTE for data transfer using an iPhone-to-Android adapter.</em></p><p>It can be very easy to sync contacts to a new phone especially if you are using a service like Google, but it is all the other stuff such as pictures, videos, text messages and your calendar that can be hard to move unless you are tech savvy. Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer makes it so easy, all you need is to simply install this software utility and then connect both phones to a PC. Both phones must however be connected at the same time in order for this service to work. This means that you cannot back up contents from your iOS device to transfer at a later time. This problem is however negated by the fact that it will take a very short time to transfer everything, so there is no need to back-up anything.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-ZTE-by-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#Steps-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-ZTE-by-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="Steps to transfer data from Apple iPhone X to ZTE by Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>Steps to transfer data from Apple iPhone X to ZTE by Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><p>So imagine how easy it would be to transfer data from your iPhone to your ZTE phone in just one click.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Get-Connected"><a href="#Step-1-Get-Connected" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Get Connected"></a>Step 1: Get Connected</h3><p>Assuming that you have downloaded and installed Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer on your computer (there are versions for both Windows and MAC), choose ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="start to transfer data from Apple iPhone X to ZTE"                ></p><p>Then connect your iPhone and ZTE phones to your computer via USB cables.

Once you apply this change, iTunes will make a dedicated folder with all the music files present in its library. In Windows, you can find it under My Music &gt; iTunes while in Mac, it would be under Music &gt; iTunes.</p><p>4. To transfer these music files, connect your Android to the system and choose to use it as a media transfer device.</p><p>5.

With eSIMs, the process of switching between devices is typically smoother compared to physical SIM cards. The reason is it involves digital activation and can be done remotely without the need to swap cards physically.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Is there a difference between switching physical SIM cards and using eSIM for transferring phone services between Apple iPhone SE and other iPhones?</strong></li></ol><p>Physical SIM cards are tangible, removable chips that need to be inserted into a SIM card tray, whereas eSIMs are integrated directly into the Apple iPhone SE device‚Äôs hardware. Swapping physical SIM cards involves physically removing and inserting the card into the new device, whereas transferring an eSIM between devices can be done remotely. Physical SIM cards can store limited contact information and some network settings, whereas eSIMs can store multiple network profiles.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article has provided a valuable overview of <strong>switching SIM cards to new Apple iPhone SE and other iPhones</strong>.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider.

They may include Apple‚Äôs official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 6s you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 6s model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty‚Äôs duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone‚Äôs condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 6s comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you‚Äôre getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose ‚Äú<strong>Export vCard</strong>.‚Äù This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to Android using iTunes<p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the ‚Äú<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>‚Äú option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync ‚ÄúAll Contacts‚Äù before clicking on the ‚Äú<strong>Apply‚Äù button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 6s device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 6s or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don‚Äôt wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android.

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 6s Plus from a private seller, make sure that it‚Äôs not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple‚Äôs official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 6s Plus you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 6s Plus model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty‚Äôs duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone‚Äôs condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 6s Plus comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you‚Äôre getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap ‚ÄúShare Contact.‚Äù From the available sharing options, select ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap ‚ÄúSend‚Äù to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won‚Äôt be added directly. To save the contact, tap ‚ÄúCreate New Contact,‚Äù write any contact details, and select ‚ÄúDone‚Äù to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?<p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device‚Äôs data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-15-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-15-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It‚Äôs basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don‚Äôt worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to iPhone.‚Äù</p><p>It‚Äôs true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it‚Äôs important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Activate-Shared-Album"><a href="#How-to-Activate-Shared-Album" class="headerlink" title="How to Activate Shared Album?"></a>How to Activate Shared Album?</h3><p>Here‚Äôs how to activate Shared Album on Settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click your Apple ID Profile.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click iCloud.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Photos.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Toggle on the radio button next to Shared Albums.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="shared album settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos"><a href="#How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Shared Albums in Photos"></a>How to Create Shared Albums in Photos</h3><p>Here‚Äôs how to create Shared Albums in Photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Photos.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Album tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the + icon at the top-left corner of your screen to add a new folder.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="add new folde"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click New Shared Album.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Rename the Shared Album and then click Create.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=22741618&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.diskpart.com/resource/images/index/dp-index-img-banner-people@2x.png"                      border="0"                >Easy and Safe Partition Software &amp;

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal.

Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature "                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-12-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-12-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 12 to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 12 to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated.

They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1.

Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

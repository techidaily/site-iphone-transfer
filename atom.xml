Transfer Data One by One from Apple iPhone X to Android for Free</h2><p>Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone X to Android. They’re totally free but just take some time.</p><h3 id="Part-1-Transfer-Apps-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-Apps-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone X to Android"></a>Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone X to Android</h3><p>As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone X or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone X to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone X or tablet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/download-apps-from-google-play.jpg"                      alt="download app from google play"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Transfer-Contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-via-iCloud"><a href="#Part-2-Transfer-Contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-via-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android via iCloud"></a>Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android via iCloud</h3><p>When switching from Apple iPhone X to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 3. Open the browser and land iCloud main page. Then, click <em>Contacts</em> to enter the contact management panel. Click <em>Show Actions Menu</em> and click <em>Export vCard…</em>. Then, contacts in iCloud will be saved as a vCard file on the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/export-icloud-contacts-from-pc.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 4. Plug a USB cable to connect your Apple iPhone X or tablet to computer. When it’s recognized, go and open the SD card of your Apple iPhone X. Cut and paste the exported vCard file to the SD card folder.</p><p>Step 5. Navigate to the Contacts app on your Apple iPhone X. Tap the menu icon left to the main button and you get the menu list. Tap <em>Import&#x2F;Export</em> and choose <em>Import from USB storage</em>. Then, import the vCard file to your Apple iPhone X.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/import-vcf-to-android2.jpg"                      alt="copy contacts from iphone to android"                ></p><p><strong>Tips:</strong> If you want to know more ways to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android, you can find more satisfying answers on ways to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to Samsung, and <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-transfer/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android.html" >switch contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Transfer-iPhone-text-messages-to-Android-with-2-Android-apps"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-iPhone-text-messages-to-Android-with-2-Android-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Have you ever wondered if there is a more affordable way to own the latest iPhone? If yes, then you are at the right place.</p><p>You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png"                      alt="A picture of a second-hand iPhone."                ></p><p>In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones. What are they, and how they can be a budget-friendly alternative?

What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini mean?</strong></h2><p>Before going further, let’s clarify what exactly a refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini is. In simple words, you can say that it is a device that has gone through a series of checks and repairs. So that it can work the same way as a brand-new Apple iPhone 13 mini does. If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.</p><p>When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 13 mini device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn’t go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 13 mini device’s functions to stop. Moreover, it’s also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.</p><p>Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone 13 mini are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Cost Savings</strong></li></ul><p>One of the major benefits of purchasing a refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini is the cost savings. These devices are more affordable than brand-new ones. You can enjoy the latest features without breaking the bank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-2.png"                      alt="An illustration of saving cost."                ></p><ul><li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong></li></ul><p>Refurbished iPhones are carefully inspected and tested to ensure that they meet Apple’s high standards. They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini will look and perform like a new iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Environmental Friendly</strong></li></ul><p>When you get a refurbished item, you’re giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that’s awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png"                      alt="An illustration of eco-friendly technology."                ></p><ul><li><strong>Warranty and Support</strong></li></ul><p>If you get a refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini from Apple, you get a one-year warranty.

Let’s find out!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-It-Safe-to-Buy-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Is-It-Safe-to-Buy-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 13 mini device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 13 mini you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 13 mini model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 13 mini comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to transfer ringtones from Apple iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by installing iTunes version 12.6 or older on your computer and launch it. Now connect your old iPhone with ringtone to the computer. In iTunes, click “Files,” hover over “Devices,” and tap “Transfer Purchases from iPhone.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/send-ringtone-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="choose transfer purchases from iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press “Sync” and wait for the ringtones to sync.

How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone With Apple’s Built-In Methods</h2><p>Moving data from one iPhone to another can be easier using Apple’s tools. These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Quick-Start"><a href="#Method-1-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Quick Start"></a>Method 1. Quick Start</h3><p>The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 15 devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone 15 to iPhone</strong> using Quick Start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the “Set Up New iPhone” prompt appears, tap “Unlock to Continue.” This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap “Continue” if you’re comfortable with that.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock new iphone"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> An animation will appear on the new iPhone’s screen, and you have to hold this animation up to the camera on your old iPhone. Once the message “Finish on New [Device]“ appears, input your old iPhone’s passcode into the new one and follow the provided setup instructions.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="setup new iphone using passcode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you reach the “Transfer Your Data” screen, opt for “Transfer Directly from iPhone” and confirm the specific settings and data you wish to transfer.

Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 3. Open the browser and land iCloud main page. Then, click <em>Contacts</em> to enter the contact management panel. Click <em>Show Actions Menu</em> and click <em>Export vCard…</em>. Then, contacts in iCloud will be saved as a vCard file on the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/export-icloud-contacts-from-pc.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 4.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated.

Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 14 to Android"></a>Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 14 to Android</h3><p>As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 14 or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 14 to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android via iCloud"></a>Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to Android via iCloud</h3><p>When switching from Apple iPhone 14 to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 3. Open the browser and land iCloud main page. Then, click <em>Contacts</em> to enter the contact management panel. Click <em>Show Actions Menu</em> and click <em>Export vCard…</em>. Then, contacts in iCloud will be saved as a vCard file on the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/export-icloud-contacts-from-pc.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 4. Plug a USB cable to connect your Apple iPhone 14 or tablet to computer. When it’s recognized, go and open the SD card of your Apple iPhone 14.

Have you ever wondered if there is a more affordable way to own the latest iPhone? If yes, then you are at the right place.</p><p>You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png"                      alt="A picture of a second-hand iPhone."                ></p><p>In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones.

They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone 14 will look and perform like a new iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Environmental Friendly</strong></li></ul><p>When you get a refurbished item, you’re giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that’s awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png"                      alt="An illustration of eco-friendly technology."                ></p><ul><li><strong>Warranty and Support</strong></li></ul><p>If you get a refurbished Apple iPhone 14 from Apple, you get a one-year warranty.

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 14 from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 14 device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 14 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 14 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 14 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone.

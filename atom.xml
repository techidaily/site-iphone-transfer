However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud.

Open the browser and land iCloud main page. Then, click <em>Contacts</em> to enter the contact management panel. Click <em>Show Actions Menu</em> and click <em>Export vCard…</em>. Then, contacts in iCloud will be saved as a vCard file on the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/export-icloud-contacts-from-pc.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 4.

Cut and paste the exported vCard file to the SD card folder.</p><p>Step 5. Navigate to the Contacts app on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

Extremely easy to use, it is a must-have tool for every smartphone user out there. To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android. Make sure that both the Apple iPhone 13 Pro devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135375/19272" target="_top" id="2135375">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135375" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135375/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 13 Pro or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard.

How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone With Apple’s Built-In Methods</h2><p>Moving data from one iPhone to another can be easier using Apple’s tools. These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Quick-Start"><a href="#Method-1-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Quick Start"></a>Method 1. Quick Start</h3><p>The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 14 Pro devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone</strong> using Quick Start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the “Set Up New iPhone” prompt appears, tap “Unlock to Continue.” This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap “Continue” if you’re comfortable with that.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock new iphone"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> An animation will appear on the new iPhone’s screen, and you have to hold this animation up to the camera on your old iPhone. Once the message “Finish on New [Device]“ appears, input your old iPhone’s passcode into the new one and follow the provided setup instructions.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="setup new iphone using passcode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you reach the “Transfer Your Data” screen, opt for “Transfer Directly from iPhone” and confirm the specific settings and data you wish to transfer. This streamlined process ensures a smooth transition to your new device while maintaining the data you want.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="transfer data from iphone"                ></p></li></ul><h3 id="Method-2-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-2-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 2. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><pre><code>Another reliable method to transfer data between iPhones is using iTunes/Finder. iTunes is available for Windows or macOS versions before Catalina. The users on macOS Catalina and later versions can use Finder to transfer data. This method allows you to create a backup of your old iPhone and restore that backup to your new device. Here is **how to transfer data to the new iPhone** via iTunes/Finder:</code></pre><h4 id="Using-iTunes-For-Windows-or-macOS-Versions-Prior-to-Catalina"><a href="#Using-iTunes-For-Windows-or-macOS-Versions-Prior-to-Catalina" class="headerlink" title="Using iTunes (For Windows or macOS Versions Prior to Catalina)"></a>Using iTunes (For Windows or macOS Versions Prior to Catalina)</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Initiate by connecting your old iPhone to your computer and launching the latest version of iTunes.

It is especially if internet connectivity is limited or they want to hurry the process. Luckily, Apple provides a method to transfer data directly from your Apple iPhone X  to the new one. It is commonly referred to as the “Quick Start” method, and you can use it by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before initiating the transfer, ensure that your Apple iPhone X  is on the latest version of iOS. You will also need to turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on the old iPhone. Power on both your Apple iPhone X  and your new iPhone 15 and place them side by side.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> A pop-up will appear on your Apple iPhone X , asking if you want to use your Apple ID to set up your new device. Confirm this action by tapping “Continue.” Your iPhone 15 will generate dynamic animation, which the old iPhone needs to capture through its camera.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/08/transfer-old-iphone-to-iphone-15-3.jpg"                      alt="press the continue button"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> This animation contains security information and establishes a connection between devices.

In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone X to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice.

Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone X comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform.

Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Activate-Shared-Album"><a href="#How-to-Activate-Shared-Album" class="headerlink" title="How to Activate Shared Album?"></a>How to Activate Shared Album?</h3><p>Here’s how to activate Shared Album on Settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click your Apple ID Profile.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click iCloud.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Photos.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Toggle on the radio button next to Shared Albums.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="shared album settings"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos"><a href="#How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Shared Albums in Photos"></a>How to Create Shared Albums in Photos</h3><p>Here’s how to create Shared Albums in Photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Photos.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Album tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the + icon at the top-left corner of your screen to add a new folder.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="add new folde"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click New Shared Album.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Rename the Shared Album and then click Create.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone in Easy Steps?"></a>How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone in Easy Steps?</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the Shared Album feature is a very convenient way to move media files from one iPhone to another.

By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice.

Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer.

Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 12 mini to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder.

That’s different from usual SMS texting. And if you leave iMessage switched on your iPhone, many of your messages will be routed via that service. If you’re on a new Google Pixel smartphone, you won’t get any of those texts. Thus, you need to turn off iMessage before you make that switch. While you’re here, disable FaceTime.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/disable-imessage.jpg"                      alt="disable-imessage"                ></p><h3 id="2-You-Might-Need-to-Buy-Your-Apps-Again"><a href="#2-You-Might-Need-to-Buy-Your-Apps-Again" class="headerlink" title="2- You Might Need to Buy Your Apps Again"></a>2- You Might Need to Buy Your Apps Again</h3><p>Have you pay-front apps on your iDevice that you paid for?

The App Store and Google Play Store are entirely different entities and the housed apps are designed for different platforms. Some apps you had on your iDevice may not even be accessible for your Google Pixel device and vice-versa. However, if you’ve subscribed to a service such as Spotify, you just have to get the app and sign in to your new Android device and that’s it.</p><h3 id="3-Re-Sync-Your-Crucial-Data"><a href="#3-Re-Sync-Your-Crucial-Data" class="headerlink" title="3- Re-Sync Your Crucial Data"></a>3- Re-Sync Your Crucial Data</h3><p>If you have all of your calendar events, contacts, documents, and photos synced with iCloud and all is on your iPhone, you’ll probably need to re-sync all on your Google Pixel device.

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone SE (2020) from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone SE (2020) you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone SE (2020) model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone SE (2020) comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal.

AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method.

Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137228/26400" target="_top" id="2137228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137228/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

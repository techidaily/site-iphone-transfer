It ensures that conversations and attachments transfer from one iPhone to another smoothly. iOS offers iCloud as the method to achieve this synchronization. It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is <strong>how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone</strong> via iCloud sync:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press “iCloud” to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="access icloud in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, tap “Show All” under the “Apps Using iCloud” section and press “Messages in iCloud.” On the ensuing screen, toggle on “Use on this iPhone” and then press the “Sync Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="sync messages in icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, move to the target device and access “iCloud” settings through the Settings app. Here, navigate to “Messages in iCloud,” and on the next screen, enable “Use on this iPhone.” Give it some time, and the messages on both devices will sync.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="toggle switch to sync messages"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Using iCloud Backup</h2><p>Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can’t restore messages selectively with this method. Here is <strong>how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone</strong> using iCloud backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open “Settings,” tap on your name, and select “iCloud.” Tap “iCloud Backup” and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on icloud backup switch"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, press “Back Up Now” to initiate an immediate backup and wait for the process to complete. Afterward, move to the new iPhone and start setting it up until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="back up now button icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next, opt for “Restore from iCloud Backup.” Then, log in to your iCloud account with the identical credentials employed during the backup process. Pick the latest backup from the available options, including the messages you aim to transfer. The restoration process will begin, and once it’s completed, open the Messages app to verify that all your message history has been transferred.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="restore data from recent icloud backup"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h2><p>Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone’s data, including messages.</p><p>Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone</strong> via iTunes&#x2F;Finder backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder.

Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Have you ever wondered if there is a more affordable way to own the latest iPhone? If yes, then you are at the right place.</p><p>You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png"                      alt="A picture of a second-hand iPhone."                ></p><p>In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones. What are they, and how they can be a budget-friendly alternative? We will answer everything you need to know.</p><p>But before starting, let’s shed some light on what refurbished iPhones actually are because some people aren’t aware of this term.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-does-a-Refurbished-Apple-iPhone-8-mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-does-a-Refurbished-Apple-iPhone-8-mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone 8 mean?"></a><strong>Part 1. What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone 8 mean?</strong></h2><p>Before going further, let’s clarify what exactly a refurbished Apple iPhone 8 is. In simple words, you can say that it is a device that has gone through a series of checks and repairs. So that it can work the same way as a brand-new Apple iPhone 8 does. If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.</p><p>When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone 8 device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn’t go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone 8 device’s functions to stop. Moreover, it’s also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.</p><p>Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 2. What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>No doubt, refurbished iPhones are the same as the new ones. So, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the brand-new Apple iPhone 8 at a lower price. If you are fine with a few scratches, refurbished iPhones have a lot more to offer you. The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone 8 are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Cost Savings</strong></li></ul><p>One of the major benefits of purchasing a refurbished Apple iPhone 8 is the cost savings. These devices are more affordable than brand-new ones. You can enjoy the latest features without breaking the bank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-2.png"                      alt="An illustration of saving cost."                ></p><ul><li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong></li></ul><p>Refurbished iPhones are carefully inspected and tested to ensure that they meet Apple’s high standards. They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone 8 will look and perform like a new iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Environmental Friendly</strong></li></ul><p>When you get a refurbished item, you’re giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that’s awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png"                      alt="An illustration of eco-friendly technology."                ></p><ul><li><strong>Warranty and Support</strong></li></ul><p>If you get a refurbished Apple iPhone 8 from Apple, you get a one-year warranty. You also get 90 days of free technical support. So, this warranty provides you peace of mind, just like you get when you buy a new iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Miscellaneous Benefits</strong></li></ul><p>Refurbished iPhones are usually available in a variety of models. They also come with the latest software updates so that you can enjoy the newest features. These phones are reliable; you can trust that they will perform well.</p><p>Well, we have explored the benefits, but is it safe to buy a refurbished iPhone? Let’s find out!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-It-Safe-to-Buy-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Is-It-Safe-to-Buy-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 8 from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 8 device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 8 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 8 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 8 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures.

However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

This process ensures your contacts are effortlessly moved between devices. This step-by-step guide proves invaluable when moving to a new iPhone or aiming to share contacts.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, you’ll discover how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud using various tools and techniques to achieve successful contact transfer. Follow these simple yet effective steps to migrate your contacts successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-1.jpg"                      alt="ipod thic pc"                ></p><h2 id="4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>We will start by exploring the 4 basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud. Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share.

However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Next, locate the iPhone from which you want to transfer the images and expand it. Choose the “Photos” tab and let Wondershare Dr.Fone load all the pictures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-ios-2.png"                      alt="choose your old iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Perform the Selective Photos Transfer</strong></p><p>Once Dr.Fone detects all the photos in your iPhone, it will categorize them in the albums like they are in your iDevice. Choose the pictures you want to transfer and tap the “To Device” option. Then, click on the iPhone on which you want to send all the selected images and complete the photo transfer process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/manage-ios-photos-2.png"                      alt="transfer the selected images"                ></p><h2 id="Method-3-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-8-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-iTunes-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-3-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-8-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-iTunes-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data. In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option.

Let’s find out!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-It-Safe-to-Buy-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-Is-It-Safe-to-Buy-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 8 from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 8 device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 8 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 8 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 8 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Quick-Start"><a href="#Method-1-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Quick Start"></a>Method 1. Quick Start</h3><p>The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 6s devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone</strong> using Quick Start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the “Set Up New iPhone” prompt appears, tap “Unlock to Continue.” This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap “Continue” if you’re comfortable with that.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock new iphone"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> An animation will appear on the new iPhone’s screen, and you have to hold this animation up to the camera on your old iPhone. Once the message “Finish on New [Device]“ appears, input your old iPhone’s passcode into the new one and follow the provided setup instructions.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="setup new iphone using passcode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you reach the “Transfer Your Data” screen, opt for “Transfer Directly from iPhone” and confirm the specific settings and data you wish to transfer.

It often arises during device upgrades, replacements, or when sharing information between devices. With the evolution of iOS versions, the methods for transferring messages have also adapted and improved. Regardless of the version, transferring messages between iPhones remains vital and relevant.</p><p>This guide will go through many techniques to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone</strong>. Our goal is to provide you with the necessary knowledge for transferring your messages between two iPhones. We will ensure a smooth transition process by offering clear step-by-step guidance and helpful tips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="transfer messages from iphone to iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Sync-Messages-Between-Two-iOS-Devices"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Sync-Messages-Between-Two-iOS-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Sync Messages Between Two iOS Devices?"></a>Part 1: How To Sync Messages Between Two iOS Devices?</h2><p>Synchronizing messages between two iOS devices is a convenient way. It ensures that conversations and attachments transfer from one iPhone to another smoothly. iOS offers iCloud as the method to achieve this synchronization. It enables users to maintain message continuity across their devices. Here is <strong>how to transfer messages from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone</strong> via iCloud sync:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure you’re signed in with the required Apple ID on both devices. Next, navigate to the “Settings” app on the source device and select “Apple ID.” On the following screen, press “iCloud” to proceed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="access icloud in settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, tap “Show All” under the “Apps Using iCloud” section and press “Messages in iCloud.” On the ensuing screen, toggle on “Use on this iPhone” and then press the “Sync Now” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="sync messages in icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, move to the target device and access “iCloud” settings through the Settings app. Here, navigate to “Messages in iCloud,” and on the next screen, enable “Use on this iPhone.” Give it some time, and the messages on both devices will sync.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="toggle switch to sync messages"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-Using-iCloud-Backup" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone Using iCloud Backup"></a>Part 2. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone Using iCloud Backup</h2><p>Transferring messages between iPhones using iCloud backup offers an efficient method. It guarantees the transfer of all your conversations, attachments, and message history. Nonetheless, a significant limitation of this approach is its exclusive usability during the setup of an iPhone. Moreover, you can’t restore messages selectively with this method. Here is <strong>how to transfer text messages from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone</strong> using iCloud backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Ensure your old iPhone is linked to a reliable Wi-Fi network. Open “Settings,” tap on your name, and select “iCloud.” Tap “iCloud Backup” and ensure the “Back Up This iPhone” toggle switch is turned on.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on icloud backup switch"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Here, press “Back Up Now” to initiate an immediate backup and wait for the process to complete. Afterward, move to the new iPhone and start setting it up until you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="back up now button icloud"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next, opt for “Restore from iCloud Backup.” Then, log in to your iCloud account with the identical credentials employed during the backup process. Pick the latest backup from the available options, including the messages you aim to transfer. The restoration process will begin, and once it’s completed, open the Messages app to verify that all your message history has been transferred.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-7.jpg"                      alt="restore data from recent icloud backup"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-via-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Part 3. How To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone via iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h2><p>Using iTunes or Finder provides an alternate method to transfer messages from one iPhone to another. iTunes is available for Windows and on macOS Mojave and earlier. The users of macOS Catalina and later can use the Finder app to use this method. This approach completely restores your previous iPhone’s data, including messages.</p><p>Ensure that both iPhones are updated to the latest iOS version and that your computer has the latest version of iTunes or Finder. This is to avoid any compatibility issues during the backup and restoration process. Here is how to <strong>transfer messages from Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone</strong> via iTunes&#x2F;Finder backup:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by connecting your old iPhone to the Mac or PC and access it in iTunes or Finder. On iTunes, click the Apple iPhone 6s device to access the “Summary” tab, while in Finder, access the “General” tab. Here, go to “Backups” and choose “Back Up Now” to create a backup for your device. Make sure to select either “This Computer” (for iTunes) or “Backup all data from your iPhone to this Mac” (for Finder).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-8.jpg"                      alt="create backup in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the backup is completed, start setting up your new iPhone. Once you reach the “Apps &amp; Data” screen, select “Restore from Mac or PC,” and follow this guide:</li></ul><p><strong>For Finder&#x2F;iTunes:</strong> Link your iPhone to the PC and gain access by clicking on the “Device” icon at the top left corner. This action will lead you to the “Welcome to Your New iPhone” screen, where the “Restore from this backup” option is pre-selected. Here, choose the desired backup and click “Continue” to kickstart the backup restoration process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-messages-from-iphone-to-iphone-9.jpg"                      alt="retore back up in itunes"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-Way-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-Without-Resetting"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-Way-To-Transfer-Messages-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-to-iPhone-Without-Resetting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The Best Way To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone Without Resetting"></a>Part 4. The Best Way To Transfer Messages From Apple iPhone 6s to iPhone Without Resetting</h2><p>iCloud and iTunes are viable options for transferring messages, but both need an entire device reset. However, synchronization of devices is limited to those sharing the same Apple ID.

I want to use my SIM on another device but can’t seem to export contacts to SIM on iPhone!”</em></p><p>Lately, lots of iPhone users have asked similar questions as they wish to save contacts to SIM card on iPhone. It might sound surprising, but it can be a little complicated to learn how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone. In this tutorial, we will answer the question – how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to SIM and provide a foolproof way to save and restore your iPhone contacts. Let’s get it started and learn more about how to export contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to SIM.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-it-possible-to-save-contacts-to-SIM-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Is-it-possible-to-save-contacts-to-SIM-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?</h2><p>A lot of users take the assistance of SIM card to save their contacts. If you are also doing the same, then you can easily learn how to import SIM contacts to iPhone. Simply go to your device’s Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar and tap on “Import SIM Contacts”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151409125783.jpg"                      alt="import sim contacts to iphone"                ></p><p>Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 14 to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn’t provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.</p><p>Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can’t export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly.

You need to connect both of your devices to your PC.</li><li>Now you will see a pop-up on both devices and you need to tap on the “Trust” button to trust the PC on both devices.</li><li>Next, you need to enter your iPhone folder from your PC and copy all the files&#x2F;folders that you want to transfer.</li><li>After that, you need to go to your Samsung device folder and choose any folder to paste all the copied files from your iPhone.</li><li>You need to wait for a while until the process finishes because it can take some time to finish.</li></ol><p>Remember, transferring data manually actually can only work for Photos. So if you want to transfer all of your photos, videos, music, call logs, messages, apps, etc. you need to choose Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer for this task.</p><h2 id="FAQS"><a href="#FAQS" class="headerlink" title="FAQS"></a>FAQS</h2><ol><li><strong>How to Transfer WhatsApp data from Apple iPhone 14 to Samsung?</strong></li></ol><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone is the best option for transferring WhatsApp data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Dr. Fone simplifies the process with its user-friendly interface and dedicated “WhatsApp Transfer” feature. Simply connect both devices to your computer, select the “WhatsApp Transfer” option, and initiate the transfer. Dr.Fone efficiently moves WhatsApp chats, messages, and media from your iPhone to the Samsung device, ensuring a seamless transition of your conversations without compromising data integrity.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Do I need to deactivate iMessage before switching?</strong></li></ol><p>Before transitioning from an iPhone to a non-Apple device, such as a Samsung phone, it is recommended to disable iMessage. This step is crucial as it prevents text messages intended for your phone number from being directed solely through iMessage. By deactivating iMessage, you facilitate the reception of SMS messages on your new Samsung device without any interference.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>What if I face issues during the transfer process?</strong></li></ol><p>In case you face any challenges while transferring data, consider these steps:</p><ul><li>Confirm that both devices have ample battery life and a reliable internet connection.</li><li>Verify for any pending software updates on both devices and proceed with their installation if available.</li><li>Review the chosen transfer method and follow the instructions to ensure accuracy and completeness.</li><li>Refer to their troubleshooting guides or customer support for assistance if using specialized apps or services.</li><li>For complex issues, consider seeking help from authorized service centers or tech support for both iPhone and Samsung.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li><strong>Can I still use my Apple Watch with my Samsung phone?</strong></li></ol><p>Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem. Unfortunately, you cannot directly pair an Apple Watch with a Samsung phone or use its full features, as it requires an iPhone for initial setup, updates, and functionality. The Apple Watch is incompatible with Android devices like Samsung phones beyond basic functionalities like displaying time.</p><p>Learning about the iPhone to Samsung transfer is easy when you have a clear and precise guideline. With the help of this article, you will not only be able to transfer data from Apple iPhone 14 to Samsung but also completely switch your device in a very short time. These 6 methods can help you solve all your confusion on how to switch from Apple iPhone 14 to Samsung easily.

You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

It has high-performing lenses and professional camera features that support various photography styles. For instance, you may use the Priotize Faster Shooting option to capture multiple photos at a time. Another thing is that you may enable Action Mode when shooting videos to keep the frame stable throughout the duration. Simply put, you can surely do a lot of things using your iPhone camera</p><p>Let’s say you’re planning to share your stunning snaps and footage with others. Is it possible to facilitate the transfer with little to no effort? The short answer is absolutely yes. There are many easy ways to move your media files between two iPhones. In no time, you can surely find the best tutorial on <strong>how to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone</strong>. Just choose one that matches perfectly your current situation.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about the iPhone’s Shared Album feature and its main benefits to users.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.</p><h3 id="How-to-Activate-Shared-Album"><a href="#How-to-Activate-Shared-Album" class="headerlink" title="How to Activate Shared Album?"></a>How to Activate Shared Album?</h3><p>Here’s how to activate Shared Album on Settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click your Apple ID Profile.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click iCloud.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Photos.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Toggle on the radio button next to Shared Albums.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="shared album settings"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos"><a href="#How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Shared Albums in Photos"></a>How to Create Shared Albums in Photos</h3><p>Here’s how to create Shared Albums in Photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Photos.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Album tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the + icon at the top-left corner of your screen to add a new folder.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="add new folde"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click New Shared Album.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Rename the Shared Album and then click Create.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone in Easy Steps?"></a>How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone in Easy Steps?</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the Shared Album feature is a very convenient way to move media files from one iPhone to another.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files.

Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android</h3><p>As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3.

However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry.

This process ensures your contacts are effortlessly moved between devices. This step-by-step guide proves invaluable when moving to a new iPhone or aiming to share contacts.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, you’ll discover how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud using various tools and techniques to achieve successful contact transfer. Follow these simple yet effective steps to migrate your contacts successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-1.jpg"                      alt="ipod thic pc"                ></p><h2 id="4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-X-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-X-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone X to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone X to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>We will start by exploring the 4 basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud. Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983472">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983472%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983472/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-X-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-X-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone X to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone X to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-13-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 14 from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 14 device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 14 you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 14 model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 14 comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone.

Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android</h3><p>As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone.

Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android via iCloud</h3><p>When switching from Apple iPhone 15 Plus to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 3. Open the browser and land iCloud main page. Then, click <em>Contacts</em> to enter the contact management panel. Click <em>Show Actions Menu</em> and click <em>Export vCard…</em>. Then, contacts in iCloud will be saved as a vCard file on the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/export-icloud-contacts-from-pc.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 4. Plug a USB cable to connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or tablet to computer. When it’s recognized, go and open the SD card of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Cut and paste the exported vCard file to the SD card folder.</p><p>Step 5. Navigate to the Contacts app on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Tap the menu icon left to the main button and you get the menu list. Tap <em>Import&#x2F;Export</em> and choose <em>Import from USB storage</em>.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though?

This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones.

It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process.

To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android.

Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 Plus to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated.

If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144280/7443" target="_top" id="2144280">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144280" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144280/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

It has high-performing lenses and professional camera features that support various photography styles.

Another thing is that you may enable Action Mode when shooting videos to keep the frame stable throughout the duration. Simply put, you can surely do a lot of things using your iPhone camera</p><p>Let’s say you’re planning to share your stunning snaps and footage with others. Is it possible to facilitate the transfer with little to no effort? The short answer is absolutely yes. There are many easy ways to move your media files between two iPhones. In no time, you can surely find the best tutorial on <strong>how to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone</strong>. Just choose one that matches perfectly your current situation.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about the iPhone’s Shared Album feature and its main benefits to users.

Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Shared-Album"><a href="#Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Shared-Album" class="headerlink" title="Everything You Need to Know About Shared Album"></a>Everything You Need to Know About Shared Album</h2><p>The Photos mobile application on iOS devices is a very powerful gallery software. It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though? If so, here are the tutorials on how to activate this feature and create one in the Photos app.</p><h3 id="How-to-Activate-Shared-Album"><a href="#How-to-Activate-Shared-Album" class="headerlink" title="How to Activate Shared Album?"></a>How to Activate Shared Album?</h3><p>Here’s how to activate Shared Album on Settings.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click your Apple ID Profile.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="apple id settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click iCloud.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click Photos.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Toggle on the radio button next to Shared Albums.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="shared album settings"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos"><a href="#How-to-Create-Shared-Albums-in-Photos" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Shared Albums in Photos"></a>How to Create Shared Albums in Photos</h3><p>Here’s how to create Shared Albums in Photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Photos.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Album tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the + icon at the top-left corner of your screen to add a new folder.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="add new folde"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135413/19272" target="_top" id="2135413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135413/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click New Shared Album.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="icloud photos"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Rename the Shared Album and then click Create.</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps"><a href="#How-to-Transfer-Photos-From-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-in-Easy-Steps" class="headerlink" title="How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone in Easy Steps?"></a>How to Transfer Photos From Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone in Easy Steps?</h2><p>Undoubtedly, the Shared Album feature is a very convenient way to move media files from one iPhone to another.

Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone XS comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal.

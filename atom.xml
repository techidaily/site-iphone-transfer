Let’s explore the steps involved in <strong>transferring data from an iPhone to a Samsung</strong> device using iTunes:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Activate-Dr-Fone-and-Connect-Samsung-Device"><a href="#Step-1-Activate-Dr-Fone-and-Connect-Samsung-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Activate Dr.Fone and Connect Samsung Device"></a><strong>Step 1: Activate Dr.Fone and Connect Samsung Device</strong></h3><p>First, access the Wondershare Dr.Fone software and connect your Samsung device to your system.

However, restoring an iCloud backup to Android devices is not as simple. iCloud only allows restoring the entire backup to iOS device setup, and it doesn’t support restoring backups to Android devices. The iCloud Manager feature in Wondershare Dr.Fone offers a solution to address this limitation.</p><p>It allows selective content restoration from iCloud backups to Samsung devices without alteration.

Then, access your device on the software from the left side and select the “iCloud Manager” option within the home screen. You have to fill in those credentials to sign into your iCloud account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="sign in to icloud id"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2: Select the Data Files and Start Restoration</strong></li></ul><p>In the next step, you have to select the data type from your iCloud backed-up data.

What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?</h2><p>Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3. Galaxy Z Fold 6</h3><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold is very similar to the Z Flip. This phone will probably have a slot for the S Pen stylus that will boost its productivity. Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975821/19272" target="_top" id="1975821">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975821" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975821/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4.

It might sound surprising, but it can be a little complicated to learn how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone. In this tutorial, we will answer the question – how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to SIM and provide a foolproof way to save and restore your iPhone contacts.

If you are also doing the same, then you can easily learn how to import SIM contacts to iPhone. Simply go to your device’s Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar and tap on “Import SIM Contacts”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151409125783.jpg"                      alt="import sim contacts to iphone"                ></p><p>Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn’t provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.</p><p>Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can’t export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly. This is because Apple assumes the transfer of contacts via SIM card is an obsolete method. Don’t worry – you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-iPhone-contacts-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-iPhone-contacts-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save iPhone contacts with Dr.Fone?"></a>Part 2: How to save iPhone contacts with Dr.Fone?</h2><p>While we can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 7 to SIM, we can try an alternative method to save our contacts.

Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer makes it so easy, all you need is to simply install this software utility and then connect both phones to a PC. Both phones must however be connected at the same time in order for this service to work. This means that you cannot back up contents from your iOS device to transfer at a later time. This problem is however negated by the fact that it will take a very short time to transfer everything, so there is no need to back-up anything.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-7-to-ZTE-by-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer"><a href="#Steps-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-7-to-ZTE-by-Dr-Fone-Phone-Transfer" class="headerlink" title="Steps to transfer data from Apple iPhone 7 to ZTE by Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer"></a>Steps to transfer data from Apple iPhone 7 to ZTE by Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer</h3><p>So imagine how easy it would be to transfer data from your iPhone to your ZTE phone in just one click.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Get-Connected"><a href="#Step-1-Get-Connected" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Get Connected"></a>Step 1: Get Connected</h3><p>Assuming that you have downloaded and installed Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer on your computer (there are versions for both Windows and MAC), choose “Switch”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="start to transfer data from Apple iPhone 7 to ZTE"                ></p><p>Then connect your iPhone and ZTE phones to your computer via USB cables.

I want to use my SIM on another device but can’t seem to export contacts to SIM on iPhone!”</em></p><p>Lately, lots of iPhone users have asked similar questions as they wish to save contacts to SIM card on iPhone. It might sound surprising, but it can be a little complicated to learn how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone. In this tutorial, we will answer the question – how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to SIM and provide a foolproof way to save and restore your iPhone contacts. Let’s get it started and learn more about how to export contacts from Apple iPhone XR to SIM.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-it-possible-to-save-contacts-to-SIM-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Is-it-possible-to-save-contacts-to-SIM-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?</h2><p>A lot of users take the assistance of SIM card to save their contacts. If you are also doing the same, then you can easily learn how to import SIM contacts to iPhone. Simply go to your device’s Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar and tap on “Import SIM Contacts”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151409125783.jpg"                      alt="import sim contacts to iphone"                ></p><p>Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone XR to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn’t provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.</p><p>Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can’t export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly. This is because Apple assumes the transfer of contacts via SIM card is an obsolete method. Don’t worry – you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-iPhone-contacts-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-iPhone-contacts-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save iPhone contacts with Dr.Fone?"></a>Part 2: How to save iPhone contacts with Dr.Fone?</h2><p>While we can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XR to SIM, we can try an alternative method to save our contacts.

Have you ever wondered if there is a more affordable way to own the latest iPhone? If yes, then you are at the right place.</p><p>You must be familiar with the idea of recycled furniture and clothes, but not many of us like the idea of second-hand phones. However, like clothing and furniture, phones can also get repaired and given a whole new life. So, why not consider this option?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-1.png"                      alt="A picture of a second-hand iPhone."                ></p><p>In this article, you will explore all about refurbished iPhones.

What does a Refurbished Apple iPhone SE mean?</strong></h2><p>Before going further, let’s clarify what exactly a refurbished Apple iPhone SE is. In simple words, you can say that it is a device that has gone through a series of checks and repairs. So that it can work the same way as a brand-new Apple iPhone SE does. If everything is done correctly, you can expect the same level of efficiency as one bought straight from the store.</p><p>When making a purchase, check the Apple iPhone SE device to see if all its functions are working. Many times, the repairing process doesn’t go well. It results in causing some of the Apple iPhone SE device’s functions to stop. Moreover, it’s also important to consider the source of the refurbished iPhone. You need to buy it from a trusted seller.</p><p>Let’s shed some light on the benefits of buying a refurbished or second-hand iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What are the Benefits of Buying a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>No doubt, refurbished iPhones are the same as the new ones. So, you will enjoy all the benefits that come with the brand-new Apple iPhone SE at a lower price. If you are fine with a few scratches, refurbished iPhones have a lot more to offer you. The benefits of buying a used Apple iPhone SE are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Cost Savings</strong></li></ul><p>One of the major benefits of purchasing a refurbished Apple iPhone SE is the cost savings.

They are also thoroughly repaired and cleaned. Often, a refurbished Apple iPhone SE will look and perform like a new iPhone.</p><ul><li><strong>Environmental Friendly</strong></li></ul><p>When you get a refurbished item, you’re giving it a longer life. This means fewer iPhones end up in the trash, and that’s awesome for our planet. So, be eco-friendly and choose a refurbished iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/10/Refurbished-iPhone-3.png"                      alt="An illustration of eco-friendly technology."                ></p><ul><li><strong>Warranty and Support</strong></li></ul><p>If you get a refurbished Apple iPhone SE from Apple, you get a one-year warranty.

You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone SE from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone SE device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone SE you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone SE model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone SE comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone.

Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone SE device.

You could always stick with the classics like Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), but what if you want something that can fully take advantage of your new gaming rig or high-end graphics card?</p><p> This is where Laminar Research comes in with their next-gen X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator—a modern take on flight sims built for more<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >current hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that. Read our review below to see how the latest X-Plane release stacks up against classics like FSX.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KBuJiu3GVH9R41cibSGIkcK_7hs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_04-9dedb800bd1340e19901349ee3ca3bda.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Preflight-checklist"><a href="#Setup-Process-Preflight-checklist" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Preflight checklist"></a><strong>Setup Process: Preflight checklist</strong></h2><p> Currently, the game is available to be purchased from a number of online retailers in either disc or digital download format. We opted to go the old-school route and purchased the game in a pack of discs, so we’ll cover this option, but if you want to grab the software online, the steps are mostly the same (even simpler).</p><p> With the complete disc booklet in hand, your first order of business will be to make sure you’ve got the space. We did mention that X-Plane 11 sports some stunning visuals, and that means lots of space is needed to store all those details. The game requires a whopping 60GB of free space, so hopefully, you’ve got some extra room on your drive.</p><p> Begin by placing the first disc into your internal or external DVD drive. The installer will start automatically and it’s easy to follow the on-screen prompts. You’ll need to swap out the discs one after the other as the instructions indicate until you complete the setup.</p><p> While many popular flight simulators are starting to show their age, X-Plane 11 is a breath of fresh air in the genre, and a breathtaking one at that.</p><p> Once your software is fully set up, you can now launch the game and get yourself flying. Be sure to adjust the settings in the menu to your specific setup for things like resolution, quality, controls, etc.</p><p> Aside from setting up your game, it’s a good idea to connect your HOTAS during the initial setup. A HOTAS, or “hands-on throttle-and-stick,” is a set of peripherals that allow you to control your in-game aircraft with more realistic inputs. Combining one of these with X-Plane 11 will increase the immersion considerably.</p><p> There are a number of these to choose from, but we went with the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS HOTAS which includes the added pedals. This unit is one of the more popular, affordable options, so we’ll briefly discuss how to set it up. Beginning with the obvious, connect all the cables to your computer’s USB ports. Don’t forget to connect the pedals to the throttle with the included cable.</p><p> Once you’ve got it hooked up, Windows should recognize the device and download the necessary drivers. When those have completed installing, you should be able to see the HOTAS connected in X-Plane 11 under the control settings. You’ll also be able to fine-tune things based on your preference from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O9MXEQGpCTKXA5qNcF6nXai8L2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_03-90ad9c4205af48bcbd8fcc163c630a5a.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Gameplay-As-close-as-you-can-get-to-flying-a-plane-in-your-home"><a href="#Gameplay-As-close-as-you-can-get-to-flying-a-plane-in-your-home" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: As close as you can get to flying a plane in your home"></a><strong>Gameplay: As close as you can get to flying a plane in your home</strong></h2><p> Booting up X-Plane 11, you’re greeted with a host of available options to choose from before your flight. While not nearly as deep as FSX, there are a lot of things you can pick between. If you’re just getting started, the Flight School will teach you the basics of flight in the game and allow you to get acclimated. If you’re not a newcomer, however, you can jump straight into the plane and environment of your choosing.</p><p> X-Plane 11 allows you to choose from a limited range of aircraft like basic prop planes to huge jumbo jets (though you can purchase more in the form of DLC). For environments, there are lots of major airports and cities to pick, and you can either select custom weather effects or go with real-world conditions updated in real-time. These options allow for a good bit of diversity, but there aren’t a ton of cool custom missions aimed at simply having fun as you’d see in FSX (no landing planes on moving buses here). The game is definitely more geared for the enthusiast who wants to replicate true to life experiences.</p><p> Users also have the ability to fine-tune their aircraft’s specs, with options for weight, fuel level and more, allowing for some interesting setups. The menus in X-Plane 11 have been more streamlined overall versus previous installations of the series, which is a welcome addition. That said, they can quickly become too complex for basic users.</p><p> The game is definitely more geared for the enthusiast who wants to replicate true to life experiences.</p><p> Jumping into a session, the gameplay feels solid, with tons of immersion and a fully clickable cockpit for each plane. You can choose to make these as complicated as you like, but the realism here is top-notch. Taxing your small Cessna across the airport of Hong Kong with the bright lights of the city all around you at night, and taking off into the sky feels awesome—about as close as you can get to flying a plane in your house.</p><p> While testing out X-Plane 11, we did experience some issues, but more so in the graphics department than the gameplay itself, which we’ll touch on in the next section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GF7rAjDnQ1m4Lngb7N3ShcMRA6U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_05-4039c04a1e16492e8b1c6024167e28f8.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006928/19272" target="_top" id="2006928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Graphics-Breathtaking-visuals-but-subpar-optimization"><a href="#Graphics-Breathtaking-visuals-but-subpar-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Breathtaking visuals, but subpar optimization"></a><strong>Graphics: Breathtaking visuals, but subpar optimization</strong></h2><p> With such a monster storage requirement, it’s no surprise that the details and graphics in X-Plane 11 are pretty remarkable. Planes themselves are the focus here, so the textures are superb. Also because Laminar chose to focus on fewer aircraft overall, the ones they’ve included all feel exceptionally well fleshed out. That tradeoff might not appeal to those who want hundreds of vehicles to select from, but it does make the selection in the game quite impressive.</p><p> Cities like New York City feature not just accurate buildings, but traffic and road layouts that really add to the experience of a living, breathing world below you.</p><p> Aside from the planes themselves, the environments you pick from feel great, with realistic cities properly laid out to their real-world counterparts. Cities like New York City feature not just accurate buildings, but traffic and road layouts that really add to the experience of a living, breathing world below you.</p><p> The skybox is an important one for flight simulators, and while X-Plane 11 improves over predecessors, it isn’t the best either. Clouds themselves are a particular eyesore, even with the settings turned up. Weather, on the other hand, looks splendid, with rain creating streaks on your windows and falling all around in spectacular fashion.</p><p> Another particularly bad graphical element is the trees. They’re one-dimensional and stick out in an otherwise beautiful environment. This is a bit of a disappointment, but isn’t a huge issue when you’re up in the air away from them.</p><p> One of the highlights of the visuals in X-Plane is the lighting. It’s high-quality and realistic, creating some incredible moments depending on your environment. Night flights are especially beautiful in the game, which has long been a favorite among fans of the franchise.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest issue is the optimization. It’s not very good, which can lead to some frustrating experiences. Even running on our PC with a high-end graphics card and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cpu-2618150" >CPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , we had some instances of stuttering and frame drops (though nothing horrid). While turning down the settings can remedy this somewhat, the setup we were using shouldn’t have an issue and is a clear indication of poor optimization. For lower-end users or those looking to run the game off integrated graphics, you’ll likely have a crippling experience in performance, even when the graphics are low. The RAM requirements are also quite high, recommending 16GB, which puts it on par with AAA games.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest issue overall with the game is the optimization. It’s not very good and can lead to some frustrating experiences.</p><p> Lastly, we do recommend running the game on an SSD if you can, as HDDs are known to create annoying pop-ins while loading landscapes during flights.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vw51Z13aohls1Ebaej2J6l1z-0E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/2LW840502X-Plane11FlightSim_02-ae4e2d16b4db412aaa3e933fd3dfc7ab.jpg"                      alt="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915810/19272" target="_top" id="1915810">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915810" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915810/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576474/17382" target="_top" id="1576474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576474/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-In-line-with-modern-games-but-pricey-DLC-not-included"><a href="#Price-In-line-with-modern-games-but-pricey-DLC-not-included" class="headerlink" title="Price: In line with modern games, but pricey DLC not included"></a><strong>Price: In line with modern games, but pricey DLC not included</strong></h2><p> Because X-Plane 11 is a relatively newer game, the price is what you’d expect from most current AAA titles. The game is currently priced at about $60-70 depending on where you purchase it, so it’s not exactly cheap, but it is average for the market.</p><p> The biggest issue is that the X-Plane, like most other simulators, has an endless list of DLC that can quickly add up if you want to get everything possible in the package. While these aren’t necessary to enjoy the game by any means, they will add replayability and offer additional experiences if you’re willing to stomach the costs.</p><p> Without a doubt, X-Plane 11 is the best current-generation flight simulator you can currently purchase.</p><p> One nice feature with X-Plane is that you do have the option to install mods. These free packs of user-generated content can really spice things up by providing custom aircraft and environments if you’re looking to add content without adding more money. They aren’t as numerous as the mod options for FSX, but they’re there if you want them.</p><h2 id="X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator-vs-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X"><a href="#X-Plane-11-Global-Flight-Simulator-vs-Microsoft-Flight-Simulator-X" class="headerlink" title="X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator vs. Microsoft Flight Simulator X"></a><strong>X-Plane 11 Global Flight Simulator vs. Microsoft Flight Simulator X</strong></h2><p> Comparing a classic staple in flight simulators like FSX to a more modern one like X-Plane 11 might feel a bit strange, but these two games are the most popular around even today. Given that FSX is about a decade older than X-Plane 11, you’ll need to understand that there are some big differences in terms of modernization between the two.</p><p> Despite its age, FSX is still a very capable sim, offering an unmatched amount of content, DLC, and mods to users looking for the absolute content. There’s something to be said for a game as old as FSX that’s still getting support and love from the fanbase. Even X-Plane 11 can’t hold a torch to the amount of replayability FSX offers.</p><p> However, X-Plane 11_is_ more modern, and that means you get a host of improvements over older simulators. The graphics will look much improved, environments are more current, the support will likely be better in years to come, and the gameplay feels tighter due to the vast advancements in tech. X-Plane 11 offers a next-gen experience that FSX will never come close to.</p><p> If your primary deciding factor is visuals, X-Plane is your go-to. If you want more content, well FSX is unmatched in that department. The price is also a bit better with FSX, but each of these titles will quickly add up if you want to get all the DLC available.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-x-gold-edition-review-4776936" >Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>The best current-gen flight simulator available now.</strong></p><p> Without a doubt, X-Plane 11 is the best current-generation flight simulator you can buy. While there are some issues with optimization, if you’ve got the computer for it, the game is stunning and currently provides the best real-world experiences.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >Alienware Aurora R7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/blade-e-flite-mcx2-rtf-rc-helicopter-review-4774670" >Blade E-flite mCX2 RTF RC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/syma-s111g-rc-helicopter-review-4774696" >Syma S111G RC Helicopter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  11 Global Flight Simulator</li><li>Product Brand  X-Plane</li><li>UPC  600246965752</li><li>Price  $64.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2017</li><li>Platform  Windows, macOS and Linux</li><li>Storage size  65 GB</li><li>Genre  Simulator</li><li>ESRB rating  E</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-build-your-affordable-virtual-reality-headgear-using-google-cards-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Build Your Affordable Virtual Reality Headgear Using Google Cards for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-brightening-up-your-youtube-content/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Brightening Up Your YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/crafting-a-harmonic-narrative-adding-youtube-music-to-vids-for-2024/"><u>Crafting a Harmonic Narrative Adding YouTube Music to Vids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/exploring-whether-itop-fits-your-tech-needs-for-2024/"><u>Exploring Whether ITop Fits Your Tech Needs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-move-custom-ringtones-from-apple-iphone-xs-max-to-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>How to Move Custom Ringtones from Apple iPhone XS Max to Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-to-samsung-galaxy-s20-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>How to Transfer from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to Samsung Galaxy S20? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-with-imei-code-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On Apple iPhone 13 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-to-iphone-8x11-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone 8/X/11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/iphone-transfer-transfer-contact-from-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-to-iphone-without-icloud-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>iPhone Transfer Transfer Contact from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/resolving-media-disconnected-issues-on-windows-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Resolving 'Media Disconnected' Issues on Windows - A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/reviving-your-logitech-c920-webcam-essential-fixes-for-a-seamless-streaming-experience/"><u>Reviving Your Logitech C920 Webcam - Essential Fixes for a Seamless Streaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/various-methods-to-transfer-pictures-from-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>Various Methods to Transfer Pictures from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android"></a>Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android</h3><p>As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or tablet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/download-apps-from-google-play.jpg"                      alt="download app from google play"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Transfer-Contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-to-Android-via-iCloud"><a href="#Part-2-Transfer-Contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-to-Android-via-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android via iCloud"></a>Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android via iCloud</h3><p>When switching from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3.

Plug a USB cable to connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or tablet to computer. When it’s recognized, go and open the SD card of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Cut and paste the exported vCard file to the SD card folder.</p><p>Step 5. Navigate to the Contacts app on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Tap the menu icon left to the main button and you get the menu list. Tap <em>Import&#x2F;Export</em> and choose <em>Import from USB storage</em>. Then, import the vCard file to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/import-vcf-to-android2.jpg"                      alt="copy contacts from iphone to android"                ></p><p><strong>Tips:</strong> If you want to know more ways to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android, you can find more satisfying answers on ways to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Samsung, and <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-transfer/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android.html" >switch contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Transfer-iPhone-text-messages-to-Android-with-2-Android-apps"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-iPhone-text-messages-to-Android-with-2-Android-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In your iPhone control panel, click <em>Back Up Now</em> to back up your iPhone to the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/itunes-backup.jpg"                      alt="transfer sms from iphone to android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 2.

Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094422/7443" target="_top" id="2094422">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094422" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094422/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 14 Plus to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the Smart Switch application. These limitations could be irritating and tiresome to do the transfer process. We have gathered and written below some common disadvantages linked with the Samsung Smart Switch:</p><ol><li>**App Data Transfer Limitation:**Smart Switch can transfer many data types and files. However, it cannot transfer all the applications and their data from an iPhone to a Samsung device. Smart Switch does not support some apps. In other scenarios, the data present in the apps can show resistance to transfer due to platform differences.</li><li>**Glitches:**Glitches during the transfer process can occur for various reasons, such as Wi-Fi connectivity issues or other potential factors. The important point is that the Smart Switch app can face interruptions mid-transfer. These interruptions could result in data loss or malfunctions in the receiving phone.</li><li>**Speed Issues:**The transfer speed of the Smart Switch application is quite impressive. Despite that, using the wireless option requires keeping the two phones in close surroundings for optimal speed. If the phones are farther apart, the transfer speed significantly decreases.</li><li>**File Format Compatibility:**Samsung Smar Switch does not fully support certain file formats or data types. When transferred to the Samsung device, these formats will require some additional steps for proper compatibility. This could affect multimedia files, documents, or specific file types.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung"><a href="#Part-4-The-Best-One-Click-Alternative-to-Samsung-Smart-Switch-for-Transferring-iPhone-to-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung"></a>Part 4: The Best One-Click Alternative to Samsung Smart Switch for Transferring iPhone to Samsung</h2><p>We have described the methods to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone 6 to Samsung</strong> via the Samsung Smart Switch application.

They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1.

Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series.

Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts.

Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-6-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6 to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone 6 device.

A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 6 and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-XS-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone XS to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone XS to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

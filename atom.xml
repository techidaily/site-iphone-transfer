Read on to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android in 5 different ways.</p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQ2GLxnD-TI"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Transfer-all-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-in-1-click"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-all-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-in-1-click" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Transfer all contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android in 1 click"></a>Part 1: Transfer all contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android in 1 click</h2><p>The easiest way to transfer all the iPhone contacts to Android is by using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit can easily transfer all your data from one device to another with a single click. The application is compatible with every leading Android and iPhone model. You can transfer your data from Apple iPhone X to Android and vice-versa. Besides a cross-platform transfer of data, <strong>iPhone to iPhone and Android to Android transfer</strong> is also supported.</p><p>The application also supports transferring all the leading data types such as videos, music, photos, messages, and so much more. Extremely easy to use, it is a must-have tool for every smartphone user out there. To learn how to move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android, you can take these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> First of all, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your Mac or Windows PC, and from its welcome screen, visit the “Phone Transfer” module.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-visit the “Switch” module"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect your Android and iOS devices to the system and let the application detect them automatically. Since you wish to export iPhone contacts to Android, iPhone should be the source while Android should be the destination device. You can use the Flip button to interchange their positions.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> select the category of data you wish to transfer. Once you have checked the “Contacts” option, click on the “Start Transfer” button to start the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-1.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-Start Transfer"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Sit back and wait for a couple of minutes as the application syncs contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android. Make sure that both the Apple iPhone X devices are kept connected to the system until the process is completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-4.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-import contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once the transfer completes, you will be shown a message. In the end, you can remove the 2 devices safely from your system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/transfer-ios-to-android-5.png"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-remove both the Apple iPhone X devices from your system"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-with-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-2-Move-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-with-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android with Google Account"></a>Part 2: Move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android with Google Account</h2><p>Another fast and hassle-free way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android is by using your Google Account. Since you can add your Google account on the iPhone, you can also use it to sync your contacts. While setting up your Android, you can use the same Google account. To learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android using your Google account, these quick steps can be implemented.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock your iPhone and go to its <strong>Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt; Add Account</strong> and tap on “Google.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-5.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-tap on “Google”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Sign in with your Google account credentials and grant your phone the needed permissions to access your Gmail data.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Now, you can go back to your Google account from here and turn on the sync option for “<strong>Contacts</strong>.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/transfer-contacts-via-google.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-turn on the sync option for “Contacts”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once your contacts are synced with your Google account, you can easily access them on any Android device. You can use the Google Contacts app or use the same account to set up your device for auto-sync contacts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-with-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-Import-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-with-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android with iCloud"></a>Part 3: Import contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android with iCloud</h2><p>Another simple way to sync contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android is by using iCloud. Firstly, you need to sync the iPhone contacts with iCloud, and later you can export them a VCF file. To this end, the vCard can be imported to Google Contacts. Yes - it does sound a bit complicated. After all, the Dr.Fone tools provide such a hassle-free way to move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android compared to this technique. Though, this is a free solution and can be your plan B. To learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android via iCloud, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Before you proceed, make sure your iPhone contacts are <strong>synced with iCloud</strong>. To do this, go to the iCloud settings and turn on the sync for 1.Contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Great! Once your contacts are synced with iCloud, you can easily access them remotely. Go to iCloud.com and <strong>log in</strong> with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> After logging in to your iCloud account, go to the “Contacts” option from the home screen.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> This will display a list of all the synced contacts. Select the contacts you wish to move. To select all contacts, click on the gear icon (settings) at the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Once you have made the desired selections, go to its settings again (the gear icon) and choose “<strong>Export vCard</strong>.” This will save a VCF file having all the contact details.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Now, go to Gmail and login with your account details. Select the Contacts option. Alternatively, you can go to the official website of Google Contacts as well.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> From here, you can choose to Import a file. Click on the vCard option and browse the saved VCF file that you have just exported from iCloud.</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Once you have imported these contacts to your Google account, you can easily access them on the connected device as well.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-using-iTunes"><a href="#Part-4-Copy-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-using-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android using iTunes"></a>Part 4: Copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android using iTunes</h2><p>If you are an avid user of iTunes, you can try this technique to export iPhone contacts to Android. Earlier, iTunes has a feature to sync contacts with Google, Outlook, and Windows account. Now, the Google feature has been removed from iTunes. Therefore, you first need to sync your contacts to your Windows account and can later export them into a card. Needless to say, the technique can also be a bit complicated. Though, you can implement these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android using iTunes.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Launch the latest version of iTunes from your system, and connect your iPhone with a cable.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Select your connected device and go to its Info tab. Enable the “<strong>Sync Contacts</strong>“ option and choose to sync them with Windows Contacts.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Ensure that you choose to sync “All Contacts” before clicking on the “<strong>Apply” button</strong>.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Great! Once you have synced your iPhone contacts to your Windows account, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone X device. Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone X or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone X and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard. In this way, all the saved contacts will be exported to your Apple iPhone X.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-14.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-restore your contacts"                ></p><p>Now that you have learned 7 different ways to move contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?"></a><strong>Part 3. Is It Safe to Buy a Refurbished iPhone?</strong></h2><p>Safety is a natural concern when buying a pre-owned iPhone. You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 15 Plus from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge.

If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 15 Plus you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 15 Plus model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone.

Here is how to selectively transfer photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without transferring the complete iPhone data via Wondershare Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Proceed With the Phone Manager feature</strong></p><p>First, you need to install Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and connect both your iDevices to the computer using the Apple-certified USB cables. Next, locate the iPhone from which you want to transfer the images and expand it. Choose the “Photos” tab and let Wondershare Dr.Fone load all the pictures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-ios-2.png"                      alt="choose your old iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Perform the Selective Photos Transfer</strong></p><p>Once Dr.Fone detects all the photos in your iPhone, it will categorize them in the albums like they are in your iDevice.

In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the “Backups” section in the “Summary” tab. Here, tap “Restore Backup” and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap “Restore” and wait for the backup to be restored.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="restore the iphone backup"                ></p><h2 id="Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner. Unlike iCloud or iTunes, it does not need to sync all the photos. You just have to select the photos from one of your iPhones and AirDrop them to another. However, the other iPhone should be within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range of the host iDevice. Here are the instructions you need to follow to AirDrop photos from old iPhone to new iPhone efficiently:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your old iPhone, you need to open the “Photos” app and hop into the desired folder. Next, pick the photos you want to share by tapping the “Select” button in the upper right corner.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, you will have to tap the “Share” icon, followed by selecting the targeted “AirDrop” recipient iPhone. Then, on the target iPhone, you have to choose “Accept” to receive them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="press the accept button"                ></p><h2 id="Tip-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-using-iCloud"><a href="#Tip-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Tip: How to Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone using iCloud"></a>Tip: How to Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone using iCloud</h2><p>Step 1.

This process ensures your contacts are effortlessly moved between devices. This step-by-step guide proves invaluable when moving to a new iPhone or aiming to share contacts.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, you’ll discover how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud using various tools and techniques to achieve successful contact transfer. Follow these simple yet effective steps to migrate your contacts successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-1.jpg"                      alt="ipod thic pc"                ></p><h2 id="4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#4-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>4 Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>We will start by exploring the 4 basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud. Each method offers its advantages and is tailored to suit different preferences. By understanding these methods, you can choose the most suitable one for your needs:</p><h3 id="Method-1-AirDrop"><a href="#Method-1-AirDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. AirDrop"></a>Method 1. AirDrop</h3><p>AirDrop is a convenient built-in feature on iPhones. It allows quick and wireless transfer of various data types, including contacts. Moreover, it ensures a hassle-free and direct exchange without extra apps or services. Follow these steps to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud using AirDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Begin by ensuring that AirDrop is enabled on both devices. For this, access the control center, expand the “Wireless” box, and long press the “AirDrop.” Now, set its visibility to “Contacts Only” or “Everyone for 10 Minutes.” Then, move your iPhone’s Contacts app and select the contact you want to share.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-2.jpg"                      alt="make iphone visible to others"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, press “Share Contact” and select “AirDrop” as the sharing method. From the available devices on AirDrop, choose the targeted device. Finally, “Accept” the incoming AirDrop on your target iPhone to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-3.jpg"                      alt="share contact using airdrop feature"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-NameDrop"><a href="#Method-2-NameDrop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. NameDrop"></a>Method 2. NameDrop</h3><p>NameDrop, integrated within iOS 17, enables the smooth sharing of contact information. All you need to do is bring your iPhone close to another iPhone. This feature eliminates the need for manual input of contact details. One of the standout advantages of NameDrop is its direct integration with AirDrop. This ensures swift and effortless sharing. Below are the steps to effortlessly share your contact information using NameDrop:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> To enable the NameDrop feature, open your iPhone settings and access the “AirDrop” option from the “General settings. Afterward, turn on the “Bringing Devices Together” feature to activate NameDrop on your iOS devices.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-4.jpg"                      alt="enable the namedrop feature "                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If Contact Posters are generated in iOS 17, they will display on both iPhones. You will be given the option to either “Share” or “Receive Only.” If you wish to exchange contact information, select “Share.” The recipient can opt for “Receive Only” to obtain your details. You can also perform these steps in the opposite direction to get contact information on your iPhone.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-5.jpg"                      alt="freceive or share contacts via namedrop"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-iTunes-Finder"><a href="#Method-3-iTunes-Finder" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder"></a>Method 3. iTunes&#x2F;Finder</h3><p>If you want a more traditional approach to copying contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud, iTunes&#x2F;Finder can be a great choice. It is a more drastic approach as it involves restoring the entire device’s data. This method is recommended if you are switching devices. Here is how you can copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes&#x2F;Finder:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> After ensuring the latest iTunes&#x2F;Finder is installed, use a USB cable to connect your source iPhone to your computer. To access the “Summary” tab in iTunes, click the “Device” icon. On Finder, select iPhone from “Locations” and access the “General” tab.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-6.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Move to the “Backups” section on iTunes&#x2F;Finder and click “Back Up Now.” Before this, confirm the selection of “This Computer” in iTunes and for Finder” or “Back up all data from your iPhone to this Mac.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-7.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the backup process is completed, remove the source iPhone and connect the target iOS device. Similarly, access the “Summary&#x2F;General” tab and click “Restore Backup.” Choose the most recent backup and follow the on-screen guidelines to complete the process.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-8.jpg"                      alt="Image alt: restore most recent backup"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Email"><a href="#Method-4-Email" class="headerlink" title="Method 4. Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

This action takes no time at all, and you can transfer the images within a matter of a few seconds.

It can also transfer videos, contacts, messages, etc., from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone. Here is how to selectively transfer photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without transferring the complete iPhone data via Wondershare Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Proceed With the Phone Manager feature</strong></p><p>First, you need to install Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and connect both your iDevices to the computer using the Apple-certified USB cables. Next, locate the iPhone from which you want to transfer the images and expand it. Choose the “Photos” tab and let Wondershare Dr.Fone load all the pictures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-ios-2.png"                      alt="choose your old iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Perform the Selective Photos Transfer</strong></p><p>Once Dr.Fone detects all the photos in your iPhone, it will categorize them in the albums like they are in your iDevice. Choose the pictures you want to transfer and tap the “To Device” option. Then, click on the iPhone on which you want to send all the selected images and complete the photo transfer process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/manage-ios-photos-2.png"                      alt="transfer the selected images"                ></p><h2 id="Method-3-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-iTunes-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-3-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-iTunes-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 3: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via iTunes [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>Using iCloud for transferring data is convenient, but it is not always practical due to the limitation of maximum data. In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the “Backups” section in the “Summary” tab. Here, tap “Restore Backup” and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap “Restore” and wait for the backup to be restored.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="restore the iphone backup"                ></p><h2 id="Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner. Unlike iCloud or iTunes, it does not need to sync all the photos. You just have to select the photos from one of your iPhones and AirDrop them to another. However, the other iPhone should be within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range of the host iDevice.

Email"></a>Method 4. Email</h3><p>Another simple way to move contacts between iPhones is through email. This approach eliminates the necessity for extra applications or software. Yet, this method might be more suitable for transferring fewer contacts. This is due to the file size limitation of email attachments. The following are the steps to share contacts via email:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Contacts app and move to the targeted contact you want to share. Select the contact and tap “Share Contact.” From the available sharing options, select “Email” and enter your email address in the recipient field.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-9.jpg"                      alt="access ios device in itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap “Send” to email the selected contacts and open the email app on your target iPhone. Find the email you sent with the contacts attached and open it. Now, retrieve the attached vCard from the email. The contact will appear in your Contacts app but won’t be added directly. To save the contact, tap “Create New Contact,” write any contact details, and select “Done” to finish saving the contact.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-iphone-without-icloud-10.jpg"                      alt="back up latest data on computer"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Problems-Linked-With-the-Basic-Methods-To-Transfer-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Problems Linked With the Basic Methods To Transfer Contacts?</h2><p>The basic methods to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone without iCloud are effective. However, they come with certain limitations that users should be aware of. AirDrop, while a quick and handy way, can only share one contact per transfer. It will become a tedious and time-consuming task when sharing the entire contacts library. The same can be said about email, where limitations on attachment size prohibit large transfers.</p><p>Using email or other online methods may raise security concerns. This is due to sensitive contact information that could be intercepted during transmission. As for NameDrop, it is only available on devices running iOS 17. Older iPhone models or software versions do not support this method. It limits the compatibility of the transfer process. Moreover, it can only allow you to share new contact information.</p><p>Local backups created through iTunes or Finder might require ample storage space. Moreover, the iTunes&#x2F;Finder backups are used to restore the entire device’s data. You cannot use them to transfer contacts with your friends or colleagues.</p><h2 id="Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-2-Advanced-Solutions-To-Transfer-Contacts-From-Apple-iPhone-6s-Plus-to-iPhone-Without-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone Without iCloud"></a>Part 3: 2 Advanced Solutions To Transfer Contacts From Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone Without iCloud</h2><p>Want to know how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone without iCloud in one click?

We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3.

However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts.

You might wonder if it is a gamble or a secure choice. The answer is that it can be very safe. However, there are a few things that you should consider before making a purchase. If you are buying it from a retailer or third-party source, make sure that they are doing refurbishing in-house. If they are outsourcing it, then it will be less secure.</p><p>On the contrary, if you are buying a refurbished Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from a private seller, make sure that it’s not a scam. You can take someone who has tech knowledge. Otherwise, make sure that he is offering you a warranty period.</p><p>It is always suggested to buy second-hand things, especially tech related, from a legitimate source. If you are about to buy a used iPhone, make sure to follow the factors discussed in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Factors-to-Consider-Before-Buying-a-Refurbished-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone."></a><strong>Part 4. Factors to Consider Before Buying a Refurbished iPhone.</strong></h2><p>Before you purchase a refurbished iPhone, there are several factors to consider. These factors will help you make the right decision. They will also help to ensure that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device meets your needs and expectations. The factors that you should consider are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Seller Reputation</strong></li></ol><p>Before you buy, do some homework on the seller. Go for the big names. They may include Apple’s official refurbishment program, authorized sellers, or trusted online markets.</p><p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p><p>Ensure the used Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max you are thinking of buying is compatible with your carrier and region. Different models may not support all networks.</p><p><strong>Storage</strong></p><p>Choose the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model and storage capacity that best suits your needs. Consider your usage and how much storage you need for apps, photos, and videos.</p><p><strong>Warranty Coverage</strong></p><p>Check the warranty that comes with the refurbished iPhone. It offers protection in case of unexpected problems. Be aware of the warranty’s duration and what it covers.</p><p><strong>Condition and History</strong></p><p>Ask questions about the phone’s condition and history. An honest seller would be willing to share everything about any prior issues and the refurbishment process.</p><p><strong>Return Policy</strong></p><p>Another critical factor is the returns policy. Without the right to return, you might end up with a malfunctioning phone. The duration of the returns policy matters as well.</p><p><strong>Original Accessories</strong></p><p>Find out if the refurbished Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max comes with any essential accessories, such as a charger and headphones. Some listings may include these items, while others may not.</p><p><strong>Price Comparison</strong></p><p>Compare prices among different sellers to ensure you’re getting a competitive deal. Keep in mind that exceptionally low prices may be a red flag.</p><p>By considering these factors, you can make the right decision when buying a refurbished iPhone. In the next section, you will explore where you can buy second-hand iPhones.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-5-Your-One-Stop-Solution-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It provides numerous options to help you organize and manage all your media files in one place. When it comes to data transfer, Photos offers users some channels to facilitate such procedures. One of which is through the syncing feature called Shared Album. It’s basically an ordinary folder where you can move and store your media files. But as the name suggests, you can share this folder with others by simply granting them access to it. Don’t worry. Your Shared Albums remain private on the platform. Only the people you add as subscribers can view its content and make changes. Therefore, the Shared Album feature is the best answer to the question: “How to transfer photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone.”</p><p>It’s true to say that Shared Album is a great iOS feature. However, it’s important to point out that it also has a few limitations. First on the list is the type of files supported by this feature. For images, Shared Album is compatible with photos in HEIF, JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, and TIFF formats. On the one hand, video formats supported by Shared Album include HEVC, MP4, QuickTime, H.264, and MPEG-4. Another thing to consider is the capacity of the Shared Album folder. By default, you can only store up to 5000 photos or videos in the album.</p><p>Do you find Shared Album a useful tool, though?

Here is how to selectively transfer photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without transferring the complete iPhone data via Wondershare Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Proceed With the Phone Manager feature</strong></p><p>First, you need to install Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and connect both your iDevices to the computer using the Apple-certified USB cables. Next, locate the iPhone from which you want to transfer the images and expand it. Choose the “Photos” tab and let Wondershare Dr.Fone load all the pictures.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/connect-ios-2.png"                      alt="choose your old iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Perform the Selective Photos Transfer</strong></p><p>Once Dr.Fone detects all the photos in your iPhone, it will categorize them in the albums like they are in your iDevice. Choose the pictures you want to transfer and tap the “To Device” option.

In that case, iTunes can be a good option, which is another functional software from Apple. Following are the step-by-step instructions to transfer pictures from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone via iTunes to avoid data storage limitations:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin with, launch iTunes on your computer and connect your source iPhone. Select the “Phone” icon near the top left corner of iTunes and move to the “Summary” tab. Then, navigate to the “Backups” section and check the “This Computer” option. Then, hit the “Back Up Now” button on the right side to start the backup process of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="tap back up now button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the backup process is complete, disconnect the old iDevice. Next, you need to connect your new iPhone and proceed to the “Backups” section in the “Summary” tab. Here, tap “Restore Backup” and go on to choose the most recent backup. To complete the photo transfer process, tap “Restore” and wait for the backup to be restored.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="restore the iphone backup"                ></p><h2 id="Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included"><a href="#Method-4-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-without-iCloud-via-AirDrop-iPhone-15-Included" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]"></a>Method 4: Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone without iCloud via AirDrop [iPhone 15 Included]</h2><p>AirDrop gives its users the wireless facility to transfer iPhone photos in a quick manner. Unlike iCloud or iTunes, it does not need to sync all the photos. You just have to select the photos from one of your iPhones and AirDrop them to another. However, the other iPhone should be within the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range of the host iDevice. Here are the instructions you need to follow to AirDrop photos from old iPhone to new iPhone efficiently:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On your old iPhone, you need to open the “Photos” app and hop into the desired folder. Next, pick the photos you want to share by tapping the “Select” button in the upper right corner.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Following this, you will have to tap the “Share” icon, followed by selecting the targeted “AirDrop” recipient iPhone. Then, on the target iPhone, you have to choose “Accept” to receive them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-iphone-6.jpg"                      alt="press the accept button"                ></p><h2 id="Tip-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-using-iCloud"><a href="#Tip-How-to-Transfer-Photos-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-iPhone-using-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Tip: How to Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone using iCloud"></a>Tip: How to Transfer Photos from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to iPhone using iCloud</h2><p>Step 1.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

Go to your Account &gt; Contacts and click on the “Export” button on the toolbar.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Choose to export the contacts to a vCard and select the location to save the VCF file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-location-to-save-contacts.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-select the location to save the VCF file"                ></p><p><strong>6.</strong> In the end, you can manually copy the VCF file to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or import it to your Google Contacts as well.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer"><a href="#Part-5-Switch-contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-Android-without-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android without a computer"></a>Part 5: Switch contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android without a computer</h2><p>Often, users don’t wish to use a computer to export iPhone contacts to Android. If you have the same requirements, then you can use a data transfer app. While there are many apps out there that can help you move contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android, I would recommend My Contacts Backup. This is because the app is available on both iOS <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/my-contacts-backup/id446784593?mt=8" >App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.globile.mycontactbackup&hl=en_IN" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. To use this app to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android, follow these steps.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Firstly, download the <strong>My Contacts app</strong> on your iPhone and launch it. Grant the app the needed permissions to access your contacts.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> The app will automatically detect all the contacts saved on your device and would give you an option to either mail them or save them to its server.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You can choose to email the contacts to your own Gmail account as well. A VCF file will be mailed to your account that can later be downloaded and synced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-13.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-email the contacts to your own Gmail account"                ></p><p><strong>4.</strong> Additionally, you can also upload the contacts to its server.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Now, you have to install the My Contacts Backup app on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and Google Play Store.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Launch the app and choose to restore your contacts using an in-app vCard. In this way, all the saved contacts will be exported to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/08/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android-14.jpg"                      alt="move contacts from iphone to android-restore your contacts"                ></p><p>Now that you have learned 7 different ways to move contacts from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Android, you can easily fulfill your requirements.

Transfer Data One by One from Apple iPhone XR to Android for Free</h2><p>Besides Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer, there are some useful ways that empower you to transfer files from Apple iPhone XR to Android. They’re totally free but just take some time.</p><h3 id="Part-1-Transfer-Apps-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Transfer-Apps-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone XR to Android"></a>Part 1. Transfer Apps from Apple iPhone XR to Android</h3><p>As you know, apps on iPhone are in .ipa, .pxl, or .deb formats, while Android apps are .apk files. Thus, it’s impossible to directly install iPhone apps on your Apple iPhone XR or tablet, let alone transfer app data from Apple iPhone XR to Android. However, many iPhone apps have their corresponding Android versions, which you can download from <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store" >Google Play Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Search Google Play on the internet and then search the apps that you play on your iPhone. Then, download and install the apps on your Apple iPhone XR or tablet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/download-apps-from-google-play.jpg"                      alt="download app from google play"                ></p><h3 id="Part-2-Transfer-Contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-via-iCloud"><a href="#Part-2-Transfer-Contacts-from-Apple-iPhone-XR-to-Android-via-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android via iCloud"></a>Part 2. Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android via iCloud</h3><p>When switching from Apple iPhone XR to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card. Although Many Android phones have also the nano sim card for changing sim card between Android and iOS flexibility, there are still some Android phone adapt bigger sim cards. That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry. If you like saving iPhone contacts to accounts, like iCloud, and Google, it’s easy to do iPhone to Android contact transfer. Here, I take iCloud as an example.</p><p>Step 1. On your iPhone, navigate to <em>Settings</em> and select <em>iCloud</em>.</p><p>Step 2. Sign in to your iCloud account and turn on <em>Contacts</em> to sync contacts between iPhone and iCloud. Calendars can also be ticked at the same time, and then sync the calendar from iCloud to Android.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/sync-icloud-with-iphone.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 3. Open the browser and land iCloud main page. Then, click <em>Contacts</em> to enter the contact management panel. Click <em>Show Actions Menu</em> and click <em>Export vCard…</em>. Then, contacts in iCloud will be saved as a vCard file on the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/export-icloud-contacts-from-pc.jpg"                      alt="transfer iphone contacts to android"                ></p><p>Step 4. Plug a USB cable to connect your Apple iPhone XR or tablet to computer. When it’s recognized, go and open the SD card of your Apple iPhone XR. Cut and paste the exported vCard file to the SD card folder.</p><p>Step 5. Navigate to the Contacts app on your Apple iPhone XR. Tap the menu icon left to the main button and you get the menu list. Tap <em>Import&#x2F;Export</em> and choose <em>Import from USB storage</em>. Then, import the vCard file to your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/import-vcf-to-android2.jpg"                      alt="copy contacts from iphone to android"                ></p><p><strong>Tips:</strong> If you want to know more ways to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android, you can find more satisfying answers on ways to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Samsung, and <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-transfer/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-android.html" >switch contacts from Apple iPhone XR to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Transfer-iPhone-text-messages-to-Android-with-2-Android-apps"><a href="#Part-3-Transfer-iPhone-text-messages-to-Android-with-2-Android-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In your iPhone control panel, click <em>Back Up Now</em> to back up your iPhone to the computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/itunes-backup.jpg"                      alt="transfer sms from iphone to android"                ></p><p>Step 2. Connect your Apple iPhone XR to computer with a USB cable. Copy the exported iTunes backup file to the SD card of your Apple iPhone XR.</p><p>Step 3.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone.

What Are the Most Recommended Upcoming Smartphones of Samsung in 2024?</h2><p>Samsung is planning to add generative AI to its new products, and they will possibly share more details next year. They’ve introduced their generative AI and given hints regarding Galaxy AI’s role in their 2024 phones. It’s a major competitor and other big names in the mobile market. We’re expecting the following mobile products from Samsung next year based on their usual launch cycle and reports.</p><h3 id="1-Galaxy-S24-Series"><a href="#1-Galaxy-S24-Series" class="headerlink" title="1. Galaxy S24 Series"></a>1. Galaxy S24 Series</h3><p>The projected launch timeline for the Galaxy S24 series is early 2024. Artificial intelligence will likely take the main area for the Galaxy S24. Samsung’s Gauss generative AI model, similar to ChatGPT, can compose emails, summarize documents, and help in coding. Additionally, the Galaxy AI is anticipated to facilitate call translations.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung’s Exynos 2400 processor guarantees a significant AI performance boost, enabling text-to-image AI generation. AI enhancements, such as Samsung’s Zoom Anywhere feature, will notably impact the camera. This feature, probably in Galaxy S24 Ultra, will enable 4x zoom for moving objects.</p><h3 id="2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6"><a href="#2-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6" class="headerlink" title="2. Galaxy Z Flip 6"></a>2. Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3><p>The rumored Galaxy Z Flip 6 expects to overcome the Z Flip 5 by introducing a new processor and more software features. These software features will benefit its foldable design. Also, the reports suggest a 50-megapixel primary camera sensor for the Z Flip 6. There is also the possibility of AI capabilities similar to those of the Galaxy S24 series. Samsung normally unveils new Galaxy Z Flip phones around August.</p><h3 id="3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6"><a href="#3-Galaxy-Z-Fold-6" class="headerlink" title="3. Galaxy Z Fold 6"></a>3.

Also, the Z Fold 6 might come with a new processor similar to the one in the Galaxy S24. Some fresh software features and slight design enhancements might be added, too.</p><h3 id="4-Galaxy-A55-5G"><a href="#4-Galaxy-A55-5G" class="headerlink" title="4. Galaxy A55 5G"></a>4.

Samsung’s Galaxy A series phones offer impressive features like multi-lens cameras and high-refresh-rate screens at more affordable prices. However, they often compromise on performance and camera quality. Also, it’s unlikely that the Galaxy A55 will use the same chip as the Galaxy S24 series.</p><p>Samsung’s Galaxy A phones usually have a slightly less powerful processor than their flagship counterparts. For instance, the Galaxy A54 uses the Exynos 1380 processor, which falls behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 series.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, the Samsung Smart Switch application provides an efficient and convenient method to <strong>transfer from Apple iPhone XS to Samsung.</strong> However, it comes with certain disadvantages and limitations that have been faced by many users.

In no time, your contacts would be restored to your device. When the process is completed, you will be notified.</p><p>That’s it! After restoring your contacts, you can safely remove the Apple iPhone XS device and use it as per your wishes. Therefore, if you have Dr.Fone Backup &amp; Restore, then you don’t need to worry about how to import contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Other-solutions-to-transfer-iPhone-contacts"><a href="#Part-3-Other-solutions-to-transfer-iPhone-contacts" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Other solutions to transfer iPhone contacts"></a>Part 3: Other solutions to transfer iPhone contacts</h2><p>While you can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM directly, you can always move your contacts from one phone to another. We have listed some easy solutions to help you resolve your query on how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone with some alternative methods.</p><h3 id="Save-your-contacts-to-iCloud"><a href="#Save-your-contacts-to-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Save your contacts to iCloud"></a>Save your contacts to iCloud</h3><p>By default, every user gets a free space of 5 GB on iCloud (which can later be expanded). Therefore, you can easily take a backup of your contacts and other important files on iCloud. Just go to your device’s Settings &gt; iCloud and turn the backup option on. Make sure that the backup for Contacts is turned on as well. This will sync your contacts to iCloud, letting you access them on the go. In this way, you don’t have to learn how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151410232814.jpg"                      alt="save iphone contacts to icloud"                ></p><h3 id="Export-iPhone-contacts-Via-iTunes"><a href="#Export-iPhone-contacts-Via-iTunes" class="headerlink" title="Export iPhone contacts Via iTunes"></a>Export iPhone contacts Via iTunes</h3><p>Another alternative to learning how to export contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM is by taking the assistance of iTunes. Simply connect your Apple iPhone XS to the system and launch iTunes. Select your iPhone and go to its “Info” tab. From here, you can sync its contacts with iTunes. This will keep your contacts safe and allow you to sync them with another iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151410449162.jpg"                      alt="export contacts from iphone using itunes"                ></p><h3 id="Copy-iPhone-Contacts-Using-Gmail"><a href="#Copy-iPhone-Contacts-Using-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Copy iPhone Contacts Using Gmail"></a>Copy iPhone Contacts Using Gmail</h3><p>Just like iCloud, you can also sync your contacts with Gmail. If you don’t use Gmail, then go to your iPhone’s Accounts Settings and set up your Gmail account. Later, you can go to Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar &gt; Gmail and toggle on the syncing option for Contacts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151410687107.jpg"                      alt="sync iphone contacts with gmail"                ></p><p>If you want, you can access your Google Contacts and import them to a vCard as well. This would be a perfect alternative to learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151410943416.jpg"                      alt="export iphone contacts to vcard"                ></p><p>We hope this guide was able to answer your question of how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone XS to SIM. Since there is no ideal solution for it, you can try different alternatives. Dr.Fone Backup &amp; Restore is one of the best ways to keep your contacts (and other types of data) safe and will certainly save the day during an emergency situation.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

This method is best suited for smaller quantities of data due to email attachment limitations. It’s effective for transferring photos, documents, contacts, or smaller files. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help with this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On your iPhone, navigate to the data you want to transfer and long-press to select it. Then, tap the “Share” icon in the drop-down list and choose to send via “Email.” Open your email app on your iPhone and create a new email. Following this, type your email address in the “To” field to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="select mail to share data"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Attach the selected files to the email. Once all the files are attached, send the email to yourself. Open the “Gmail” app on your Samsung device and access the email you sent yourself from the iPhone. Next, open the email and download the attached files to your Samsung device. You can download them by tapping the “Download” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/11/switching-from-samsung-to-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="download the attached files"                ></p><p><strong>Data Can Be Transferred:</strong> Photos, Documents (PDFs, Word files, etc.), Contact vCards (individual contacts), Notes or Text-based Information, Small Video Files, or Audio Recordings.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-transfer-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-Samsung-manually"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-transfer-from-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max-to-Samsung-manually" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to transfer from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Samsung manually?"></a>Part 6: How to transfer from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Samsung manually?</h2><p>If you are interested in moving from Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to Samsung, then you can easily follow this part.

Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone X to Android via iCloud</h3><p>When switching from Apple iPhone X to Android, one of the most important content you want to transfer is contacts. Unfortunately, the iPhone sim card is smaller than the one on Android phone and iPhone contacts are usually saved in a phone memory card.

That means, it’s not available to just insert iPhone sim card on Android phone, which usually works in <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/transfer/transfer-contacts-from-phone-to-phone.html" >transferring contacts from Android to Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Don’t worry.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data. It is a little embarrassing to start over and over again with transferring the data.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Motorola-G5"><a href="#Part-1-Easy-solution-1-click-to-transfer-data-from-Apple-iPhone-X-to-Motorola-G5" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone X to Motorola G5"></a>Part 1: Easy solution - 1 click to transfer data from Apple iPhone X to Motorola G5</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/" >Dr.Fone - Phone Transfer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used for transferring data from to phone to another phone like messages, contacts, call logs, calendar, photos, music, video and apps.  Also you can back up your iPhone and save the data on your pc, for example, and restore later when you wish.

Usually you can use Migrate application after you downloaded and installed on your phone. After you open the app you should enter your logins for iCloud and the transfer of your data will start when you login into your Google account, too. You should know that several contact and calendar field names differ between iCloud and Google, like “Work – Phone” in iCloud is “Phone” in Google. But probably this is not the big issue.</p><p>One bigger problem can be that you could have duplicate contacts after transferring your data. If you have the same contacts for example in your iCloud and in your Google account, those contacts will be duplicated. Even it is a slower way, you could try to merge similar contacts by going to your contacts in Gmail, highlighting your iCloud contact group and select “Find and merge duplicates”.</p><p>For calendar, one issue might be that the new calendar data are not shown on your phone. If you cannot find the best method that works for you, like syncing the calendar from iCloud or syncing from your Google account, you should start over with the migration of data.

Yet, the process of migrating your data from one iOS device to another can appear overwhelming. With every iPhone model update, Apple unveils new features and functionalities. It can potentially complicate the transfer procedure. In this extensive guide, we’ll simplify the process of <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone</strong>.</p><p>We’ll offer detailed, step-by-step guidance and explore many methods to ensure an efficient transition. By the end of this guide, you’ll possess the necessary know-how to effortlessly transfer your valuable data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="transfer data from iphone to iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-With-Apple’s-Built-In-Methods"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Transfer-Data-From-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-to-iPhone-With-Apple’s-Built-In-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone With Apple’s Built-In Methods"></a>Part 1. How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone With Apple’s Built-In Methods</h2><p>Moving data from one iPhone to another can be easier using Apple’s tools. These features are already on your iPhone and make it simple and reliable to transfer your data. Given below are the three built-in solutions from Apple for <strong>how to transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone</strong>:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Quick-Start"><a href="#Method-1-Quick-Start" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Quick Start"></a>Method 1. Quick Start</h3><p>The Quick Start feature from Apple offers a way to transfer data from your previous iPhone to a new device without any hassle. This method utilizes a direct wireless connection between the Apple iPhone 13 Pro devices. That makes the transition swift and efficient. Follow these steps to <strong>transfer data from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone</strong> using Quick Start:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin by turning on your new iPhone and placing it beside your old iPhone. When the “Set Up New iPhone” prompt appears, tap “Unlock to Continue.” This process will use the Apple ID associated with your old phone, so tap “Continue” if you’re comfortable with that.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock new iphone"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> An animation will appear on the new iPhone’s screen, and you have to hold this animation up to the camera on your old iPhone. Once the message “Finish on New [Device]“ appears, input your old iPhone’s passcode into the new one and follow the provided setup instructions.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/transfer-data-from-iphone-to-new-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="setup new iphone using passcode"                ></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you reach the “Transfer Your Data” screen, opt for “Transfer Directly from iPhone” and confirm the specific settings and data you wish to transfer.

I want to use my SIM on another device but can’t seem to export contacts to SIM on iPhone!”</em></p><p>Lately, lots of iPhone users have asked similar questions as they wish to save contacts to SIM card on iPhone. It might sound surprising, but it can be a little complicated to learn how to save contacts to SIM on iPhone. In this tutorial, we will answer the question – how to transfer contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to SIM and provide a foolproof way to save and restore your iPhone contacts. Let’s get it started and learn more about how to export contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to SIM.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-it-possible-to-save-contacts-to-SIM-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-Is-it-possible-to-save-contacts-to-SIM-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?"></a>Part 1: Is it possible to save contacts to SIM on iPhone?</h2><p>A lot of users take the assistance of SIM card to save their contacts. If you are also doing the same, then you can easily learn how to import SIM contacts to iPhone. Simply go to your device’s Settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendar and tap on “Import SIM Contacts”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2018/01/15151409125783.jpg"                      alt="import sim contacts to iphone"                ></p><p>Though, the problem occurs when users wish to do vice versa and learn how to import contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to SIM. As of now, Apple doesn’t provide a direct solution to export contacts to SIM on iPhone. If you really wish to save contacts to SIM on iPhone, then you have to jailbreak your device once. After jailbreaking your device, you can use certain apps to move contacts to SIM easily.</p><p>Though, if your device has not been jailbroken, then you can’t export contacts to SIM on iPhone directly. This is because Apple assumes the transfer of contacts via SIM card is an obsolete method. Don’t worry – you can try an alternative method to save and backup contacts on iPhone. We have discussed it in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-save-iPhone-contacts-with-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-save-iPhone-contacts-with-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to save iPhone contacts with Dr.Fone?"></a>Part 2: How to save iPhone contacts with Dr.Fone?</h2><p>While we can’t learn how to copy contacts from Apple iPhone 6s to SIM, we can try an alternative method to save our contacts.
